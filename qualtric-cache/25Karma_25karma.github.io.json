    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The react-icons package is used extensively throughout the 25Karma project for displaying icons in various components such as the Navbar, Footer, Accordion, and more. These icons are crucial for the user interface, providing visual cues and enhancing the user experience. Given the widespread use and the role of icons in the UI, the functionality provided by react-icons is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The react-icons package is deeply integrated into the 25Karma project, with imports and usage spread across multiple components and pages. The project has a dedicated ReactIcon component that wraps react-icons, indicating a level of abstraction and integration. Replacing react-icons would require updating all these imports and potentially refactoring the ReactIcon component, which indicates a high level of difficulty in replacing the dependency.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available for icons in React projects, such as Material-UI Icons, Font Awesome, and others. These alternatives offer similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements. However, switching to an alternative would require evaluating the new package's compatibility with the project's needs, updating imports, and potentially adjusting the UI to accommodate differences in icon sets. While feasible, this process would be time-consuming and somewhat difficult.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on react-icons' abandonment is moderate. While the package is widely used and maintained, the open-source nature of the project means that maintenance could cease if the maintainers decide to stop supporting it. However, given the package's popularity and the availability of alternatives, the project could switch to another icon library if necessary.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of react-icons to the project's UI, the depth of its integration, the availability of alternatives, and the likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of react-icons would be impactful to the 25Karma project. The project relies heavily on this package for its visual design, and replacing it would require significant effort.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @tippyjs/react dependency is used for tooltips in the project, which are a common UI element for providing additional information or context. While tooltips enhance user experience, they are not critical to the core functionality of the project, which is to view player stats on the Hypixel Network. Therefore, the functionality provided by @tippyjs/react is somewhat important but not essential.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project through a single component (Tippy.jsx) that handles tooltips. The integration is straightforward, with the component being used to wrap elements that require tooltips. This suggests that the dependency is not deeply integrated into the project's codebase, making it relatively easy to replace if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available for tooltips in React, such as react-tooltip and react-popper. These alternatives offer similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements for @tippyjs/react. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace the dependency.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The project is a web application that does not rely on specific external services or APIs that could change in a way that would necessitate replacing the tooltip functionality. Additionally, the dependency is not critical to the project's core functionality, reducing the urgency of any potential replacement.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, the abandonment of @tippyjs/react would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The functionality it provides, while useful, is not critical to the core operations of the project. Additionally, the dependency is not deeply integrated into the codebase, and there are several viable alternatives available. Therefore, the project could continue to function effectively even if the dependency were to be abandoned.",

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @vitejs/plugin-react is crucial for the project as it enables Fast Refresh in development, uses the automatic JSX runtime, and allows for custom Babel plugins/presets. Given that the project is built with React and relies on Vite for development and building, the functionality provided by this plugin is essential for a smooth development experience and efficient production builds.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @vitejs/plugin-react in the project is minimal but critical. It is used in the vite.config.js file to configure the Vite build process for React. While its usage is straightforward, replacing it would require understanding and potentially reconfiguring the build process, which could introduce risks and complexities.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternatives to @vitejs/plugin-react, such as using Webpack with its React-specific plugins or other build tools that support React. However, these alternatives may require significant changes to the project's configuration and build process. The availability of alternatives is moderate, but the effort to switch could be substantial.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The plugin is maintained by the Vite team, which is actively developed and widely used in the React community. However, unforeseen circumstances in the React or Vite ecosystems could potentially impact this.",

    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @vitejs/plugin-react to the project's development and build process, its minimal but critical integration, the availability of alternatives with potential switching costs, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would likely be impactful to the project.",
