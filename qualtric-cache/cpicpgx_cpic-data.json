      "reasoning": "Axios is used in multiple critical parts of the project for making HTTP requests, including updating publications, genes, and making pair updates. It is essential for interacting with external APIs and fetching necessary data.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Axios is integrated into several key scripts within the project, including updatePublications.js, updateGenes.js, makePairUpdates.js, and lookupPublication.js. It is used for both GET and POST requests, indicating a deep integration into the project's functionality.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to Axios, such as the Fetch API or other HTTP request libraries like node-fetch or got, Axios's ease of use, promise-based nature, and wide adoption make it a preferred choice. However, switching to an alternative would require refactoring the codebase, which is feasible but time-consuming.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given Axios's popularity and active maintenance, the likelihood of it being abandoned in the near future is low. However, the project should still monitor the dependency's status and community support to mitigate any potential risks.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of Axios to the project's functionality, its deep integration, and the availability of alternatives, the abandonment of Axios would be impactful but manageable. The project would need to allocate resources to refactor the codebase to use an alternative HTTP request library.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency dayjs is used in the project to format dates in a changelog file. While date formatting is a common task, the specific usage in this project is limited to a single script (writeChangelog.mjs) and does not appear to be critical to the core functionality of the CPIC data model or API. Therefore, the functionality provided by dayjs is of low importance to the project.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of dayjs in the project is minimal. It is used in only one script (writeChangelog.mjs) to format dates for a changelog file. The usage is straightforward and does not involve complex logic or deep integration with other parts of the project. Replacing dayjs in this context would be relatively simple.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available for date manipulation and formatting in JavaScript, such as date-fns, luxon, and moment.js. These alternatives offer similar or even more comprehensive functionality compared to dayjs. Given the availability of these alternatives, replacing dayjs would not be difficult.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the abandonment of dayjs is low. The project's usage of dayjs is minimal and not critical to its core functionality. Additionally, the availability of alternative packages reduces the risk of being forced to act due to abandonment.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the low importance of dayjs to the project, its minimal integration, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of dayjs would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

      "reasoning": "The @semantic-release/git plugin is used to commit release assets to the project's git repository. While this functionality is useful for automating the release process, it is not critical to the core functionality of the CPIC Data project, which is focused on creating and maintaining the CPIC data model. The project could still function and release updates manually without this plugin, albeit with more effort.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @semantic-release/git plugin is integrated into the project's release process as part of the semantic-release configuration in the package.json file. However, its role is limited to committing release assets, and it does not deeply integrate with the core codebase or data processing logic of the CPIC Data project. Replacing or removing this plugin would require adjustments to the release process but would not significantly impact the project's main functionality.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @semantic-release/git for automating git operations in a release process, including custom scripts or other npm packages that offer similar functionality. These alternatives could be used to achieve the same goal of committing release assets to the git repository. The availability of suitable replacements reduces the difficulty of replacing @semantic-release/git.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The @semantic-release/git plugin is not directly tied to the core functionality of the CPIC Data project, and its abandonment would not prevent the project from continuing to operate or release updates. The project could continue to use the plugin as long as it remains functional, or switch to an alternative solution if necessary.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the analysis, the abandonment of the @semantic-release/git dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the CPIC Data project. The plugin's functionality, while useful, is not critical to the project's core operations, and there are viable alternatives available. The project could continue to operate and release updates without significant disruption in the event of the plugin's abandonment.",
