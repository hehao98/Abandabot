    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @angular/common package is a core part of the Angular framework, providing essential services and directives that are fundamental to Angular applications. Given that Keira3 is built using Angular, the functionality provided by @angular/common is crucial for the application's operation, including features like HTTP client services, routing, and more.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "@angular/common is deeply integrated into the project, as it is a core dependency of Angular. Replacing it would require a significant overhaul of the application's architecture, potentially affecting all components and services that rely on Angular's core functionalities.",

    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are other frameworks and libraries available for building web applications, such as React or Vue.js, switching to an alternative would not be straightforward. It would require rewriting a significant portion of the application, as Angular's architecture and concepts differ substantially from those of other frameworks.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. Angular is a widely used and actively maintained framework, and @angular/common is a core part of it. However, the risk cannot be entirely ruled out, as the open-source ecosystem is unpredictable.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role of @angular/common in the Angular framework and its deep integration into the Keira3 project, its abandonment would have a significant impact. The project would face substantial challenges in finding a suitable replacement and adapting the application to a new framework or library. Therefore, the abandonment of @angular/common would likely be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @fortawesome/fontawesome-free package is used for providing icons in the Keira3 project. While icons are important for user interface design and user experience, they are not critical to the core functionality of the application, which is a database editor for the AzerothCore MMORPG framework. The application could still function without these icons, albeit with a less visually appealing interface.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @fortawesome/fontawesome-free in the Keira3 project is limited to SCSS files for styling. It is used to import font styles and icons into the project's CSS. This level of integration suggests that replacing the dependency would primarily involve updating the SCSS imports and possibly some HTML elements that use these icons. The integration is not deeply embedded in the core logic or functionality of the application.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @fortawesome/fontawesome-free for providing icons in web applications, such as Material Icons, Ionicons, and Bootstrap Icons. These alternatives offer similar functionality and could be used as replacements with minimal changes to the project's codebase. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace @fortawesome/fontawesome-free if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. Font Awesome is a widely used and well-maintained library with a large community and corporate backing. While any open-source project can potentially be abandoned, the risk of this happening with Font Awesome in the near future is considered minimal.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance, integration depth, availability of alternatives, and likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of @fortawesome/fontawesome-free would not likely be directly impactful to the Keira3 project. The dependency is used for non-critical UI elements, is not deeply integrated, has several viable alternatives, and is unlikely to be abandoned in the near future.",

It is integrated into various components and services, indicating its importance in providing user feedback and enhancing the user experience. The dependency is used in critical parts of the application, such as handling database connection status and user interactions, making it a key component of the project's functionality.",

It is used in various contexts, including error handling, success notifications, and user feedback. The dependency is tightly coupled with the project's core functionalities, such as database operations and user interactions, indicating a high level of integration.",

    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternative notification libraries available for Angular, such as Angular Material's Snackbar or ngx-notifications, replacing ngx-toastr would require significant refactoring due to its widespread use and specific configurations throughout the project. The availability of alternatives does not necessarily make the replacement process straightforward, as it would involve updating numerous components and services to accommodate the new library's API and behavior.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on ngx-toastr's abandonment is moderate. While the library is actively maintained and widely used, changes in Angular's ecosystem or the emergence of more efficient notification libraries could potentially lead to its deprecation. However, given its current stability and popularity, such a scenario is not imminent but remains a possibility in the long term.",
      "score": 3

    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of ngx-toastr in providing user feedback and its deep integration into the project, its abandonment would likely have a significant impact on the project. The dependency is used in critical parts of the application, and replacing it would require substantial effort. While there are alternatives available, the process of switching to another library would be complex and time-consuming. Therefore, the abandonment of ngx-toastr would be impactful to the project.",
