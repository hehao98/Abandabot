    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The eslint-config-prettier dependency is used to disable ESLint rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier. This is crucial for maintaining code formatting consistency and avoiding conflicts between ESLint and Prettier. Given that the project includes both ESLint and Prettier as devDependencies and uses them for linting and formatting, the functionality provided by eslint-config-prettier is highly important to ensure smooth integration between these tools.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of eslint-config-prettier in the project is straightforward, as it only requires adding 'prettier' to the 'extends' array in the ESLint configuration. This minimal integration means that replacing or removing eslint-config-prettier would not be difficult from a codebase perspective. However, its role in ensuring compatibility between ESLint and Prettier makes it a critical part of the development setup.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are no direct alternatives to eslint-config-prettier that provide the same functionality of disabling ESLint rules that conflict with Prettier. While it might be possible to manually configure ESLint to avoid these conflicts, this would be time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore, finding a suitable replacement that offers the same ease of use and effectiveness would be challenging.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the abandonment of eslint-config-prettier is low. The dependency is well-maintained and widely used in the JavaScript ecosystem. Additionally, its role is specific to integrating ESLint and Prettier, which are both stable and widely adopted tools. Changes in the JavaScript ecosystem that would necessitate action on this dependency are unlikely.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of eslint-config-prettier in ensuring compatibility between ESLint and Prettier, its minimal but critical integration, the lack of direct alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would be impactful to the project. It plays a key role in the development workflow by preventing conflicts and ensuring code formatting consistency.",

  },
  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency 'stylelint-config-standard' is used for linting CSS code, ensuring it adheres to modern conventions and standards. Given the project's focus on extending Step and handling document attributes, CSS linting is not a core functionality but rather a supportive one for maintaining code quality. Therefore, its importance to the project is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of 'stylelint-config-standard' in the project is minimal. It is only referenced in the '.stylelintrc.json' file to extend its configuration. There are no direct code dependencies or integrations in the main project codebase, making it relatively easy to replace or remove.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative CSS linting configurations and tools available, such as 'stylelint-config-recommended' and custom configurations. These alternatives can provide similar functionality, making it not particularly difficult to replace 'stylelint-config-standard' with another suitable option.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. CSS linting standards and practices evolve slowly, and there are multiple alternatives available. The project could continue using the current version or switch to an alternative without significant impact.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of CSS linting to the project, the minimal integration of 'stylelint-config-standard', the availability of alternative packages, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

      "reasoning": "TypeScript is used as a development dependency in the project, primarily for type checking and compiling TypeScript code into JavaScript. The project's build process, linting, and testing scripts all rely on TypeScript. Given that TypeScript is integral to the development workflow and the project's build process, its functionality is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "TypeScript is deeply integrated into the project's development and build processes. It is used in the build scripts, linting configurations, and testing frameworks. The project's source code is likely written in TypeScript, given the presence of TypeScript-specific configurations and dependencies. Replacing TypeScript would require significant changes to the build process, linting rules, and potentially the source code itself.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to TypeScript, such as Babel for transpiling JavaScript and Flow for type checking, these alternatives may not provide the same level of integration and features that TypeScript offers. Additionally, migrating to an alternative would require significant effort to adjust the build process, linting rules, and potentially the source code. The availability of alternatives does not significantly reduce the difficulty of replacing TypeScript.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on TypeScript's abandonment is relatively low. TypeScript is widely used and supported by a large community, including major companies. However, if TypeScript were to be abandoned, the project would need to find an alternative to maintain its development workflow and build process.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the deep integration of TypeScript into the project's development and build processes, its abandonment would likely be directly impactful to the project.
