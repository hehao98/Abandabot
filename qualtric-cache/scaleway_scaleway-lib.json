    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/react package provides TypeScript definitions for React, which is crucial for projects using TypeScript with React. Given that the project scaleway/scaleway-lib includes multiple React-based packages and uses TypeScript, the functionality provided by @types/react is highly important for ensuring type safety and developer experience.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/react package is deeply integrated into the project as it is used across multiple packages within the project, as indicated by the CHANGELOG.md files. Replacing it would require updating all these packages, which indicates a high level of integration.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternative TypeScript definition packages for React, @types/react is the most widely used and maintained. Finding a suitable replacement that is as comprehensive and up-to-date would be challenging, making the replacement difficulty high.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the widespread use of React and TypeScript in the industry, it is unlikely that external environmental changes would force the project to act on the abandonment of @types/react. However, if React itself were to change significantly, it could impact the relevance of @types/react.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the high importance of @types/react for type safety in a TypeScript and React-based project, its deep integration across multiple packages, the challenge in finding a suitable alternative, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @types/react would likely be directly impactful to the project.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The `read-pkg` dependency is used in the `vite.config.ts` file to read the `package.json` file. This functionality is crucial for the build process as it helps in determining external and bundled dependencies. Without it, the build configuration would not be able to correctly identify which dependencies should be externalized or bundled, potentially leading to incorrect builds.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of `read-pkg` in the project is limited to the `vite.config.ts` file, where it is used to read the `package.json` file. This is a single point of integration, and replacing it would require changes only in this file. The depth of integration is shallow, making it relatively easy to replace.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to `read-pkg` that can read and parse `package.json` files, such as `load-json-file` and `read-package-up`. These alternatives provide similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives makes it easier to replace `read-pkg` if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The functionality provided by `read-pkg` is stable and well-established, and there are no immediate signs of environmental changes that would necessitate a replacement.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of `read-pkg` in the build process, its shallow integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of `read-pkg` would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could relatively easily switch to an alternative package if needed.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The 'globals' package is used in the project to define global variables for different JavaScript environments, particularly in the ESLint configuration. This functionality is crucial for ensuring that the project's code adheres to the correct global variable usage, which is important for maintaining code quality and preventing potential runtime errors. However, the direct impact on the project's core functionality is limited, as it primarily serves as a support tool for static analysis.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The 'globals' package is integrated into the project's ESLint configuration and is used in a few test files. Its usage is not deeply embedded in the project's core codebase but is instead confined to configuration and testing environments. This makes it relatively easy to replace or remove without significant refactoring of the main codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to the 'globals' package that provide similar functionality, such as 'eslint-plugin-node' and 'eslint-plugin-browser'. These alternatives can offer comparable global variable definitions and are widely used in the JavaScript ecosystem. The availability of these alternatives makes it easier to replace 'globals' if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The 'globals' package is stable and widely used, and its functionality is not likely to be affected by changes in the JavaScript ecosystem. Additionally, the project's usage of 'globals' is not critical to its core functionality, reducing the urgency of any potential abandonment.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance, integration, alternatives, and likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of the 'globals' dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The package's role is supportive rather than critical, and there are viable alternatives available. The project could continue to function effectively even if 'globals' were to be abandoned, with minimal effort required to transition to an alternative solution.",
