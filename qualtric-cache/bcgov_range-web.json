    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The project 'bcgov/range-web' is a React-based web application, as indicated by the presence of 'react' and 'react-dom' in the package.json file. React-dom is crucial for rendering React components in the DOM, which is a core functionality of any React application. The project's entry point (src/index.js) uses ReactDOM.render to mount the main App component, indicating that react-dom is essential for the application to function.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "React-dom is deeply integrated into the project, as it is used in the main entry point (src/index.js) to render the application. Additionally, it is used in specific components (e.g., src/components/rangeUsePlanPage/grazingSchedules/RowMenu.js) for rendering portals. This level of integration suggests that replacing react-dom would require significant changes to the codebase, including the main rendering logic and any components that use ReactDOM.createPortal.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to react-dom for rendering React applications (e.g., react-native for mobile apps, or server-side rendering libraries), these alternatives are not direct replacements and would require a significant shift in the project's architecture and possibly its goals. For a web application like 'bcgov/range-web', react-dom is the standard and most suitable choice, making the availability of direct alternatives limited.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on react-dom's abandonment is low. React-dom is a core part of the React ecosystem, which is maintained by Facebook and a large community of developers. The React ecosystem is stable and widely used, making it unlikely that react-dom would be abandoned without a suitable replacement or migration path being provided.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role of react-dom in rendering React applications, its deep integration into the project, the limited availability of direct alternatives, and the low likelihood of its abandonment, the abandonment of react-dom would be highly impactful to the 'bcgov/range-web' project. It would require significant effort to replace and could potentially affect the application's functionality and performance.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Prettier is used as a code formatter in the project, ensuring consistent code style across the codebase. While it does not directly contribute to the core functionality of the application, it plays a crucial role in maintaining code quality and readability, which indirectly supports the development process and collaboration among team members.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Prettier is integrated into the project's development workflow through the 'pretest' and 'prettier' scripts in package.json, and it is also referenced in the .eslintrc configuration file. However, its integration is not deeply embedded into the core application logic or build process, making it relatively straightforward to remove or replace.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative code formatters available, such as ESLint's formatting rules, StandardJS, and Beautify. These alternatives can provide similar functionality to Prettier, making it feasible to replace Prettier if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Prettier's abandonment is low. Prettier is widely used and supported by a large community, and its abandonment would likely be gradual, giving the project ample time to find and implement an alternative.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of Prettier in maintaining code quality and readability, its relatively shallow integration into the project, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of Prettier would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @storybook/addon-knobs dependency is used in the project for dynamically editing props in Storybook stories. This functionality is crucial for testing and showcasing components in different states, which is a significant part of the development process. However, it is not directly related to the core functionality of the Range Web application, which is focused on managing cattle range on crown lands. Therefore, while important for development and testing, it is not critical to the application's main purpose.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project's Storybook setup, as seen in the .storybook/addons.js file and various story files. It is used as a decorator in multiple component stories, indicating a moderate level of integration. However, it is not deeply embedded in the core application logic or functionality, making it relatively straightforward to replace or remove if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency's README mentions that it is being deprecated in favor of @storybook/addon-controls, which suggests that there is a direct alternative available. Additionally, Storybook's ecosystem is rich with various addons and tools that could potentially serve as replacements, providing similar or enhanced functionality. This availability of alternatives makes the replacement process less difficult.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given that the dependency is already marked as deprecated in favor of @storybook/addon-controls, it is highly likely that external environmental changes, such as updates to Storybook or its ecosystem, will force the project to act on the dependency's abandonment. The project may need to migrate to the recommended alternative to ensure compatibility and support.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the dependency for development and testing, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the high likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @storybook/addon-knobs would be impactful but manageable. The project would need to plan for a migration to an alternative solution, but this would not directly affect the core functionality of the application.",
