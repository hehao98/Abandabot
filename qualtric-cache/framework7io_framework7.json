    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The 'glob' dependency is used in multiple build scripts within the Framework7 project, including scripts for building core styles, components, and typings. Its functionality is crucial for file pattern matching during the build process, which is a fundamental part of the project's development workflow.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The 'glob' dependency is integrated into several build scripts, indicating a deep integration within the project's build system. It is used for file pattern matching across different directories and file types, which is essential for the build process. Replacing it would require significant changes to these scripts.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available for file pattern matching in Node.js, such as 'fast-glob' and 'globby'. These alternatives offer similar functionality and could potentially serve as suitable replacements. However, switching to an alternative would require testing and adjustments to ensure compatibility with the existing build scripts.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While 'glob' is a widely used package with a large community, the JavaScript ecosystem is dynamic, and changes in the ecosystem or the package itself could necessitate a switch to an alternative.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the importance of the 'glob' dependency to the project's build process, its deep integration into multiple build scripts, and the availability of alternative packages, the abandonment of 'glob' would likely be impactful to the project. However, the impact could be mitigated by switching to an alternative package, provided that the necessary adjustments are made to the build scripts.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The prop-types package is used for runtime type checking of React props, which is crucial for maintaining code quality and preventing bugs in large-scale applications. Given that Framework7 supports React, the functionality provided by prop-types is important for ensuring that components receive the correct types of props. However, the core functionality of Framework7 does not solely depend on prop-types, as it also supports other frameworks like Vue and Svelte. Therefore, while important, it is not critical to the core functionality of Framework7.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of prop-types in the Framework7 project is limited to the React components. The package is used in the development process to ensure that components receive the correct types of props. However, the integration is not deeply embedded in the core functionality of Framework7, as it also supports other frameworks. Replacing prop-types would require updating the React components to use a different type-checking mechanism, but it would not affect the overall architecture of Framework7.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to prop-types for runtime type checking in React, such as TypeScript, Flow, and custom validation functions. These alternatives can provide similar or even enhanced functionality compared to prop-types. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace prop-types if necessary. However, transitioning to an alternative would require some effort to refactor the existing codebase.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The prop-types package is maintained by Facebook and is widely used in the React ecosystem. While there is always a risk of a package being abandoned, the widespread use and support for prop-types reduce this risk. Additionally, the availability of alternatives provides a safety net in case of abandonment.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of prop-types for type checking in React components, the relatively shallow integration in the Framework7 project, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of prop-types would not likely be directly impactful to the Framework7 project. The project could transition to an alternative type-checking mechanism with moderate effort.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency 'less' is used extensively throughout the project for styling components. It is integrated into the core framework and used in multiple components for theme management and styling. The functionality provided by 'less' is crucial for the project's visual presentation and theme consistency.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The 'less' dependency is deeply integrated into the project's codebase. It is used in the core framework and across multiple components for styling and theme management. The project has a dedicated build process for handling 'less' files, indicating a high level of integration.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to 'less' such as 'Sass', 'PostCSS', and 'Stylus' that could potentially replace it. However, transitioning to an alternative would require significant refactoring of the project's styling logic and build process, as 'less' is deeply integrated into the project.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While 'less' is a widely used tool, the ecosystem of CSS preprocessors is competitive, and shifts in popularity or support could impact the project. However, 'less' has been stable and widely used for a long time, reducing the immediate likelihood of such changes.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the extensive use and deep integration of 'less' in the project, its abandonment would likely be directly impactful. The project relies on 'less' for core styling and theme management, and while there are alternatives, transitioning would require significant effort. Therefore, the abandonment of 'less' would be impactful to the project.",
