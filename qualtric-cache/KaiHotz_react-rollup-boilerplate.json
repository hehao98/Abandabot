    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @rollup/plugin-terser plugin is used to minify the output bundle, which is a crucial step in optimizing the final build for production. Minification reduces the size of the JavaScript files, leading to faster load times and improved performance. Given that the project is a boilerplate for React libraries, the optimization of the final build is essential for the end-users of libraries created with this boilerplate. Therefore, the functionality provided by @rollup/plugin-terser is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The plugin is integrated into the project's build process through the rollup configuration file (rollup.config.mjs). It is listed among other plugins used for the build process, indicating that it is a part of the standard build pipeline. However, its integration is straightforward and does not involve complex configurations or deep modifications to the project's codebase. Replacing it would require finding another minification plugin compatible with Rollup and adjusting the rollup configuration accordingly.",

    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @rollup/plugin-terser for minifying JavaScript code in Rollup projects, such as rollup-plugin-uglify and rollup-plugin-babel-minify. These alternatives offer similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace @rollup/plugin-terser, provided that the chosen alternative is compatible with the project's setup and requirements.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is relatively low. The plugin is well-maintained and widely used in the Rollup ecosystem. However, if the plugin were to be abandoned, the project might need to switch to an alternative to ensure continued support and compatibility with future versions of Rollup and other dependencies.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of minification in the build process, the straightforward integration of @rollup/plugin-terser, the availability of alternative minification plugins, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @rollup/plugin-terser would be impactful but manageable. The project would need to find and integrate a suitable alternative to maintain the optimization of the final build.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @storybook/addon-interactions dependency is used within the Storybook setup of the project, which is a crucial part of the development process for visualizing and testing components. However, the project's README and package.json do not indicate that the addon is central to the core functionality of the library being developed. It appears to be more of a convenience for development rather than a necessity for the library's operation.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @storybook/addon-interactions is limited to the Storybook configuration file (.storybook/main.ts). It is listed among other addons, suggesting that its removal or replacement would not deeply affect the project's codebase. The dependency is not intertwined with the core library code or its build process.",

    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @storybook/addon-interactions that provide similar functionality for testing and interacting with components in Storybook. These include other Storybook addons and general testing libraries that can be integrated into Storybook. The availability of alternatives makes it less difficult to replace this dependency.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The project's dependency on Storybook and its addons is for development purposes, and changes in the ecosystem are less likely to impact the core functionality of the library. Additionally, the project's use of @storybook/addon-interactions is not deeply integrated, reducing the impact of its abandonment.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, the abandonment of @storybook/addon-interactions would not likely be directly impactful to the project. Its role is more supportive in the development process rather than essential for the library's functionality. The ease of finding alternatives and the low integration depth further reduce the potential impact.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @storybook/react dependency is crucial for the project as it is used for developing and showcasing components in Storybook. The project's README emphasizes the importance of Storybook for component development and provides specific scripts for building and deploying Storybook. This indicates that Storybook is a core part of the development workflow.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project's configuration files (.storybook/main.ts and .storybook/preview.ts) and is used in component stories (e.g., src/components/Tabs/Tabs.stories.tsx). However, the integration seems to be limited to Storybook-specific files and does not deeply penetrate the core logic of the project. This suggests that while the dependency is important, its integration is not overly complex.",

    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @storybook/react, such as Docz, Styleguidist, and Docusaurus, which can also be used for documenting and showcasing React components. These alternatives provide similar functionalities and could potentially replace @storybook/react if needed. The availability of these alternatives makes the replacement process less difficult.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While Storybook is a popular tool, the React ecosystem is dynamic, and changes in best practices or the emergence of new tools could influence the project's dependency choices. However, given the current stability and popularity of Storybook, such changes are not imminent.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @storybook/react to the project's development workflow, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of this dependency would be impactful but not critically so. The project could transition to an alternative with some effort, but the immediate impact on the development process would be noticeable.",
