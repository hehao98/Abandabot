    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The framer-motion library is used in the project for animations and transitions, as seen in the usage overview and code snippets. It provides essential functionality for creating smooth and interactive user experiences, which is crucial for a personal website aiming to engage visitors. The library's features like springs, keyframes, and layout animations are directly used in the project, indicating its importance.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of framer-motion in the project is moderate. It is used in specific components and hooks, such as useLerpTransform and Message components, indicating a focused but not deeply pervasive integration. Replacing it would require updates to these components but would not necessitate a complete overhaul of the project's codebase.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to framer-motion, such as react-spring and react-transition-group, which also offer animation capabilities for React applications. These alternatives are well-maintained and could potentially serve as suitable replacements, making the transition feasible with some effort.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. framer-motion is a popular and actively maintained library with a strong community and corporate backing. However, the dynamic nature of open-source projects means that the risk, while low, is not zero.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of framer-motion to the project's user experience, its moderate level of integration, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of forced action due to external changes, the abandonment of framer-motion would be impactful but manageable. The project would need to invest time in transitioning to an alternative, but the impact would not be catastrophic.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The project is a personal website built with Next.js and TypeScript. React-hot-toast is used for displaying notifications, which is a common but not critical feature for a personal website. While it enhances user experience by providing feedback, the core functionality of the website does not depend on it. Therefore, its importance is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "React-hot-toast is integrated into the project as a dependency, and its usage is straightforward, primarily involving the `toast` function and `Toaster` component. Given its simplicity and the lack of deep integration into the project's core logic, replacing it would not be highly difficult.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to react-hot-toast in the React ecosystem, such as react-toastify, notistack, and others, which offer similar or even more features. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace react-hot-toast if needed.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. React-hot-toast is a stable library with a good maintenance history, and its abandonment would not directly affect the project's core functionality or its ability to operate.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of react-hot-toast to the project, the ease of its integration, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of react-hot-toast would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The `uuid` dependency is used to generate unique identifiers for elements in the `MorphingShapes` experiment. While this functionality is important for the specific experiment, it does not appear to be a core feature of the overall project. The project's README does not mention `uuid` or its functionality, suggesting it is not critical to the project's main purpose.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The `uuid` dependency is used in a single file (`src/pages/experiments/morphing-shapes.tsx`) to generate unique keys for elements. This is a relatively shallow integration, as it does not affect the core functionality of the project and is limited to a specific experiment. Replacing or removing this dependency would likely require minimal changes to the codebase.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available for generating unique identifiers, such as `nanoid` and `cuid`. These alternatives are widely used and could serve as suitable replacements for `uuid`. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace `uuid` if necessary.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The `uuid` package is widely used and maintained, with a strong community and regular updates. There is no immediate indication that it will be abandoned or that external environmental changes will force the project to act on its abandonment. However, the possibility of future changes in the JavaScript ecosystem or the package's maintenance status could impact its likelihood of abandonment.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the limited importance of the `uuid` dependency to the project, its shallow integration, the availability of alternative packages, and the low likelihood of its abandonment, the abandonment of `uuid` would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",
