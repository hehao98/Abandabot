    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @rollup/plugin-node-resolve is crucial for the project as it allows Rollup to locate and bundle third-party modules from node_modules. This functionality is essential for the build process of the project, ensuring that all dependencies are correctly included in the final bundle. Given its role in the build process, the functionality provided by this dependency is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project's build process through its use in the Rollup configuration files across different packages (simplebar, simplebar-react, simplebar-vue). Its usage is straightforward, primarily for resolving modules, which means its integration is not deeply intertwined with the project's core logic. However, replacing it would require updating the Rollup configuration files across these packages, which, while not overly complex, does involve multiple files.",

    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative packages that could potentially replace @rollup/plugin-node-resolve, such as webpack's resolve plugin or other Rollup plugins designed for module resolution. However, these alternatives may require adjustments in the build configuration and could introduce compatibility issues or differences in behavior. The availability of alternatives provides some flexibility, but the specific features and reliability of @rollup/plugin-node-resolve make it a preferred choice.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is relatively low. The dependency is well-maintained and widely used in the JavaScript ecosystem, reducing the risk of sudden abandonment. Additionally, the project's build process is not highly susceptible to changes in the external environment that would necessitate immediate action on this dependency.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @rollup/plugin-node-resolve in the project's build process, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would be impactful but not critically so. The project could manage the transition to an alternative with some effort, but the dependency's current role is significant enough to warrant attention if it were to be abandoned.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @babel/preset-typescript dependency is crucial for the project as it allows the project to use TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript. This is particularly important for maintaining code quality, improving developer productivity, and catching errors at compile time. Given that the project is a library that likely aims to support a wide range of use cases and environments, the ability to use TypeScript is significant.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project's build process through the .babelrc.json configuration file. It is listed as a preset, which means it is a fundamental part of the Babel configuration used to transpile TypeScript code into JavaScript. However, its integration is not deeply embedded into the project's core logic or functionality, making it relatively straightforward to replace if necessary.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @babel/preset-typescript for transpiling TypeScript code, such as using the TypeScript compiler (tsc) directly or other Babel presets/plugins that offer similar functionality. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace @babel/preset-typescript, provided that the project is willing to adjust its build configuration accordingly.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is relatively low. TypeScript and Babel are both widely used and supported in the JavaScript ecosystem, and any significant changes that would affect @babel/preset-typescript would likely be well-communicated and have a long lead time. Additionally, the project could switch to an alternative transpiler if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @babel/preset-typescript to the project's build process and the availability of alternatives, the abandonment of this dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could transition to an alternative solution with some effort, but the core functionality and user experience would remain unaffected.",

      "reasoning": "The jest-environment-jsdom dependency is crucial for testing React components in a browser-like environment. Given that the project, Grsmto/simplebar, supports React and likely has React components that need testing, the functionality provided by jest-environment-jsdom is important for ensuring the reliability and correctness of these components.",

      "reasoning": "The integration depth of jest-environment-jsdom in the project's code base is moderate. It is used in the testing environment, which is a significant part of the development process but not directly in the production code. Replacing it would require updating the test configurations and possibly some test cases, but it wouldn't affect the core functionality of the project.",

      "reasoning": "There are alternatives to jest-environment-jsdom, such as jsdom directly or other testing environments that simulate a browser environment.
