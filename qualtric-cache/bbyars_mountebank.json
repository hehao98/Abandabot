    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The http-proxy-agent is used to handle HTTP proxy connections in the project. Given the project's focus on service virtualization and the need to support various protocols, including HTTP, the functionality provided by http-proxy-agent is crucial for proxying HTTP requests. This is evident from its usage in the src/models/http/httpProxy.js file, where it is used to set the proxy agent for HTTP requests. Therefore, the functionality provided by this dependency is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of http-proxy-agent in the project is limited to a specific part of the codebase, specifically within the src/models/http/httpProxy.js file. It is used to set the proxy agent for HTTP requests based on environment variables. This indicates a moderate level of integration, as it is not deeply embedded across the entire codebase but is essential for the functionality it provides.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available that provide similar functionality to http-proxy-agent, such as proxy-agent and tunnel. These alternatives can also handle HTTP and HTTPS proxy connections and could potentially serve as suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace http-proxy-agent if needed.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is relatively low. The http-proxy-agent is a well-established package with a stable API, and there are no immediate signs of it becoming abandoned. However, the open-source nature of the package means that there is always a possibility of abandonment, but it is not highly likely in the near future.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the functionality provided by http-proxy-agent to the project, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternative packages, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of http-proxy-agent would likely be impactful to the project. However, the impact is mitigated by the availability of alternatives and the specific, limited integration of the dependency.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The 'nc' dependency is listed in the 'devDependencies' section of the package.json file, indicating it is used for development purposes rather than being a core part of the mountebank application. Given the context provided, there is no direct evidence that 'nc' is critical to the core functionality of mountebank, which is a service virtualization tool. Therefore, its importance to the project is considered low.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Since 'nc' is a development dependency and not directly integrated into the core functionality of mountebank, replacing it would likely have minimal impact on the project's codebase. The integration depth of 'nc' in mountebank appears to be shallow, based on the provided context.",

    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available that provide similar functionality to 'nc', such as 'netcat' and 'socat'. These alternatives could serve as suitable replacements if needed. The availability of these alternatives makes replacing 'nc' relatively easy.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given that 'nc' is a development dependency and not a core part of the mountebank application, it is unlikely that external environmental changes would force the project to act on 'nc's abandonment. The project could continue to function without 'nc' or switch to an alternative with minimal disruption.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the low importance of 'nc' to the mountebank project, the shallow depth of its integration, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action on its abandonment, the abandonment of 'nc' would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

      "reasoning": "The escape-html dependency is used to escape HTML content in the logsController.js file, which is crucial for preventing XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks. Given the security implications, the functionality provided by escape-html is highly important to the project.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is used in a single file (logsController.js) for escaping HTML content before rendering it in the response. Its integration is limited to this specific functionality, making it relatively easy to replace or remove.",
