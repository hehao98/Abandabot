    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The handlebars-wax dependency is used to register partials, helpers, and data in the Handlebars templating engine, which is crucial for rendering views in the project. Given its role in the view engine setup, it is highly important for the project's functionality.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "handlebars-wax is integrated into the project's view engine setup, specifically in the app.js file where it is used to register partials and helpers. Its integration is deep as it directly affects how views are rendered, but it is localized to the view engine setup, making it moderately difficult to replace.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternatives to handlebars-wax for registering partials, helpers, and data in Handlebars, such as manually registering them or using other libraries that offer similar functionality. However, these alternatives may require significant changes to the codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. Handlebars and its ecosystem are stable, and handlebars-wax is a utility that, while useful, does not directly depend on external services or APIs that could change.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the importance of handlebars-wax in the project's view engine setup and its deep integration, its abandonment would be impactful. However, the availability of alternatives and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action mitigate the impact.",

  },
  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The handlebars-layouts dependency is used to implement layout blocks in the project's Handlebars templates. This functionality is crucial for structuring and organizing the views in a consistent manner. Given that the project is a client-side application with a significant focus on rendering views, the ability to manage layouts effectively is highly important.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project by being registered as a helper in the Handlebars instance. This integration is straightforward and does not involve deep modifications to the project's codebase. However, it is used in the core view rendering logic, which means that replacing it would require adjustments in how views are structured and rendered.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to handlebars-layouts, such as handlebars-helpers, handlebars-layout, and others that offer similar functionality. These alternatives could potentially serve as suitable replacements, but the transition would require testing and possibly some adjustments to the templates to ensure compatibility.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the project is currently being deprecated in favor of a new frontend implementation in Vue.js, the existing client still relies on Handlebars for rendering. If handlebars-layouts were to be abandoned, it could impact the maintenance and further development of the current client.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of layout management in the project's view rendering, the moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the likelihood of environmental changes, the abandonment of handlebars-layouts would be somewhat impactful. However, given the project's ongoing transition to a new frontend technology, the direct impact on the project's future development is limited.",

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The 'compression' middleware is used to compress response bodies, which can significantly reduce the size of the data sent over the network, improving the performance of the application. Given that the project is a client-server application, network performance is crucial. Therefore, the functionality provided by 'compression' is important for the project.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The 'compression' middleware is integrated at a high level in the application's middleware stack, as indicated by its usage in 'app.js'. This suggests that it is applied to all routes, making it deeply integrated into the project. Replacing it would require careful consideration to ensure that all routes continue to benefit from response compression.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available that provide similar compression functionality, such as 'zlib' and 'brotli'. These alternatives are well-maintained and could serve as suitable replacements. However, switching to an alternative would require some effort to ensure compatibility and similar performance benefits.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The 'compression' package is widely used and maintained by the Express.js team, which reduces the likelihood of it being abandoned. However, external environmental changes, such as advancements in compression algorithms or changes in Node.js core modules, could potentially force the project to consider alternatives.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of response compression for network performance, the depth of integration in the project, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the 'compression' package's abandonment would likely be impactful to the project. However, the impact could be mitigated by switching to an alternative compression middleware.",
