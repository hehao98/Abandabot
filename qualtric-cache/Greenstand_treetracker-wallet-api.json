    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The 'pg' dependency is crucial for the project as it is used extensively for database operations. The project's README and package.json indicate that 'pg' is the primary PostgreSQL client for Node.js, and it is used in various scripts and server configurations for database connections, migrations, and operations. Given its central role in database interactions, the functionality provided by 'pg' is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The 'pg' dependency is deeply integrated into the project's codebase. It is used in multiple scripts for database operations, server configurations, and testing environments. The project's setup and database operations heavily rely on 'pg', making it difficult to replace without significant refactoring of the codebase.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternative PostgreSQL clients for Node.js, such as 'pg-promise' and 'sequelize', replacing 'pg' would require careful consideration of compatibility and feature parity. The project's extensive use of 'pg' and its specific configurations would make transitioning to an alternative package challenging and time-consuming.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While 'pg' is a widely used and maintained package, changes in PostgreSQL or Node.js ecosystems could necessitate updates or changes. However, given 'pg's stability and community support, such changes are not highly likely in the near term.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of 'pg' to the project's database operations, its deep integration into the codebase, the challenges in finding and transitioning to a suitable alternative, and the moderate likelihood of external changes necessitating action, the abandonment of 'pg' would likely be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "ESLint is used for linting the codebase, which is crucial for maintaining code quality and consistency. The project has multiple scripts and configurations that rely on ESLint, as seen in the package.json and .eslintrc.json files. However, while important, ESLint is not directly involved in the core functionality of the application, which is more focused on wallet and transaction management.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "ESLint is integrated into the project through the package.json scripts and configuration files. It is used in various parts of the codebase, as indicated by the usage overview. However, its integration is not deeply embedded into the core application logic but rather used as a development tool. Replacing ESLint would require updating the package.json scripts and configuration files, but it would not require significant changes to the core application code.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to ESLint available, such as Prettier, JSHint, and TSLint (for TypeScript). These tools offer similar functionality for linting and code formatting. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace ESLint if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on ESLint's abandonment is low. ESLint is a widely used and actively maintained tool with a large community and corporate backing. While it's possible for any open-source project to be abandoned, the risk is lower for a project with such widespread use and support.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of ESLint for code quality, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of ESLint would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could transition to an alternative linting tool with relatively low effort.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The eslint-plugin-import is a development dependency used for linting ES2015+ import/export syntax. While it is important for maintaining code quality and preventing issues with misspelling of file paths and import names, it is not directly involved in the core functionality of the project. Its role is more supportive rather than critical to the project's operation.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of eslint-plugin-import in the project is through the ESLint configuration, which is a common setup for JavaScript projects. Replacing it would require updating the ESLint configuration to use a different plugin or set of rules. This process is straightforward and does not involve deep changes to the project's codebase.",

    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to eslint-plugin-import, such as eslint-plugin-node, eslint-plugin-jsdoc, and others that can provide similar linting capabilities for ES2015+ import/export syntax. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace eslint-plugin-import if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. ESLint and its plugins are widely used in the JavaScript ecosystem, and there is a strong community support. However, if the plugin were to be abandoned, the impact would be minimal given the availability of alternatives and the non-critical nature of the dependency.",

    "reasoning": "Considering the importance, integration, alternatives, and likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of eslint-plugin-import would not likely be directly impactful to the project.
