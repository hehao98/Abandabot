    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The `react-native-svg` dependency is used in the project to render SVG elements, specifically in the barcode generation feature. Given that SVG rendering is crucial for displaying barcodes, which are likely an essential part of the application's functionality, the importance of this dependency is high.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project through direct usage in the barcode component and configuration in the metro.config.js file. The integration is moderate as it involves both direct usage in components and build configuration, but it does not appear to be deeply intertwined with the core logic of the application.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative packages available for SVG rendering in React Native, such as `react-native-svg-charts` or `react-native-art`. However, `react-native-svg` is the most widely used and supported library for this purpose, making it the de facto standard. Finding a suitable replacement that offers the same level of functionality and community support could be challenging.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The `react-native-svg` library is actively maintained and widely used in the React Native ecosystem. However, if the library were to be abandoned, the project might need to find an alternative or fork the library to continue using it.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of SVG rendering for the barcode feature, the moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of `react-native-svg` would likely be impactful to the project. However, the impact could be mitigated by finding a suitable alternative or forking the library.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Font Awesome provides a suite of icons that are used for UI elements in the project. While icons are important for user interface design, they are not critical to the core functionality of the project. The project could continue to function without these icons, albeit with a less visually appealing interface.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Font Awesome is integrated into the project via a single import in a SCSS file. This indicates a shallow level of integration, as there are no direct references to Font Awesome in the project's JavaScript or TypeScript code. Replacing Font Awesome would primarily involve updating the SCSS file to use a different icon library.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are numerous alternative icon libraries available, such as Material Icons, Feather Icons, and Ionicons, which could serve as suitable replacements for Font Awesome. These libraries offer similar functionality and could be integrated into the project with minimal effort.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Font Awesome's abandonment is low. Font Awesome is a widely used and well-maintained library, and there is no immediate indication that it will be abandoned. Even if it were abandoned, the project could continue to use the existing version without significant issues.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the shallow integration of Font Awesome in the project, the availability of numerous alternative icon libraries, and the low likelihood of Font Awesome being abandoned, the abandonment of Font Awesome would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could easily switch to another icon library with minimal effort.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The csv-parse dependency is used in multiple parts of the project, including the Icelandic Names Registry backend and the My Pages portal for parsing CSV files. Given that CSV parsing is a critical functionality for data processing in these components, the dependency is important for the project's operations.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "csv-parse is integrated into the project's codebase in a few specific areas, such as data processing in the Icelandic Names Registry backend and file parsing in the My Pages portal. While it is used in critical functionalities, its integration is not deeply spread across the entire codebase, making it somewhat replaceable with some effort.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available for CSV parsing in the JavaScript ecosystem, such as PapaParse and fast-csv. These alternatives offer similar functionalities and could potentially replace csv-parse with some adjustments to the code.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the availability of alternative CSV parsing libraries and the specific use cases of csv-parse within the project, it is somewhat likely that external environmental changes (such as the abandonment of csv-parse) could force the project to act. However, the impact would be manageable with the adoption of an alternative library.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of csv-parse for specific functionalities within the project, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternative libraries, and the likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of csv-parse would be impactful but manageable. The project would need to invest some effort in replacing it, but the impact would not be catastrophic.",
