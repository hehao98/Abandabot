    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The babel-preset-env dependency is crucial for the project as it compiles ES2015+ down to ES5, ensuring compatibility with targeted browsers. This is essential for the project's frontend code, which is built using a yarn and webpack-based system. The project's README highlights the importance of browser support requirements, and babel-preset-env directly addresses this by automatically determining the necessary Babel plugins and polyfills based on the targeted environments.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of babel-preset-env in the project is deep, as it is listed in the package.json under the babel presets. This indicates that it is a fundamental part of the build process for the project's JavaScript code. Given that the project uses a webpack-based build system for CSS and Javascript, and considering the presence of babel-preset-env in the babel configuration, it is clear that this dependency is tightly integrated into the project's build and development workflow.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to babel-preset-env, such as manually configuring Babel plugins or using other presets like babel-preset-latest, these alternatives do not offer the same level of convenience and automation in targeting specific browser environments. The project's reliance on babel-preset-env for its browser support requirements suggests that finding a suitable replacement that offers similar functionality and ease of use would be challenging.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. Given the project's focus on browser compatibility and the specific use of babel-preset-env to address this, any significant changes in browser standards or the JavaScript ecosystem could necessitate a reevaluation of this dependency. However, the project's current setup and the stability of babel-preset-env mitigate this risk to some extent.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the critical role of babel-preset-env in ensuring browser compatibility for the project's frontend code, its deep integration into the build process, the challenges in finding a suitable replacement, and the moderate likelihood of external changes necessitating action, the abandonment of this dependency would likely be directly impactful to the project.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The `array.prototype.every` dependency is used as a polyfill to ensure compatibility with older environments that do not support the `Array.prototype.every` method. Given the project's focus on providing a user-friendly budget portal for South Africa, ensuring broad browser compatibility is crucial. However, the direct impact of this specific polyfill on the project's core functionality is limited, as it is part of a broader set of polyfills aimed at ensuring compatibility rather than providing unique or critical functionality.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of `array.prototype.every` into the project is minimal. It is used in a single file (`polyfillOldFeatures.js`) to polyfill the `Array.prototype.every` method if it is not already present. This indicates a shallow level of integration, as the dependency is not deeply embedded in the project's codebase and is used in a straightforward manner to ensure compatibility.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives available for polyfilling the `Array.prototype.every` method, including other polyfill libraries and even custom implementations. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace `array.prototype.every` if necessary. The existence of these alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacing the dependency.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The `Array.prototype.every` method is a standard part of JavaScript, and its support is widespread in modern environments. The need for a polyfill is primarily for older environments, and as these environments become less prevalent, the necessity of the polyfill decreases.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, the abandonment of the `array.prototype.every` dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The dependency's role is limited to ensuring compatibility with older environments, and its integration into the project is minimal. Additionally, there are readily available alternatives, and the likelihood of external changes necessitating action on this dependency is low.",

      "reasoning": "Prettier is used as a code formatting tool in the project, specifically integrated with ESLint for enforcing code style rules. While it plays a crucial role in maintaining code quality and consistency, its functionality is not directly tied to the core features of the project, such as budget data management or user interface rendering. Therefore, its importance is significant but not critical to the project's primary operations.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Prettier is integrated into the project through ESLint configuration, as seen in the .eslintrc.js file. This integration is relatively straightforward and does not deeply intertwine with the project's core logic or functionality. Replacing Prettier would primarily involve updating ESLint configurations and possibly adopting a different code formatting tool, which is manageable without extensive codebase changes.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative code formatting tools available that could serve as suitable replacements for Prettier, such as ESLint's own formatting rules, StandardJS, or Beautify. These alternatives offer similar functionality and could be integrated with minimal adjustments to the project's existing setup. The availability of these alternatives makes replacing Prettier a feasible task.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Prettier's abandonment is low. Prettier is widely used and supported in the JavaScript ecosystem, and its abandonment would likely be gradual, giving the project ample time to adapt. Additionally, the project's reliance on Prettier is not so critical that its abandonment would immediately disrupt operations.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, Prettier's abandonment would not likely be directly impactful to the project. Its role, while important for code quality, is not critical to the project's core functionalities. The ease of integration and the availability of alternatives further reduce the potential impact of its abandonment.",
