      "reasoning": "The @textlint/markdown-to-ast dependency is used to parse Markdown files into an abstract syntax tree (AST) in the cypress-markdown-preprocessor project. This functionality is crucial for the project's core feature of using Markdown files as Cypress specs. Without this dependency, the project would not be able to process and convert Markdown files into executable test cases. Therefore, the functionality provided by this dependency is highly important to the project.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @textlint/markdown-to-ast dependency is integrated into the project's codebase through the src/markdown-utils.js file, where it is used to parse Markdown content into an AST. This integration is relatively deep, as the parsed AST is essential for the subsequent processing and execution of test cases. Replacing this dependency would require significant changes to the codebase to accommodate a different Markdown parsing mechanism.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available that can parse Markdown into an AST, such as 'remark' and 'markdown-it'. These alternatives are well-maintained and could potentially serve as suitable replacements for @textlint/markdown-to-ast. However, switching to an alternative would require adjustments to the codebase to ensure compatibility with the new parsing mechanism.",

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the dependency is crucial for the project's functionality, the existence of alternative Markdown parsing libraries means that the project could switch to a different library if necessary. However, such a switch would require effort and could introduce compatibility issues.",

    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the @textlint/markdown-to-ast dependency to the project's core functionality, the depth of its integration, the availability of alternative packages, and the likelihood of external environmental changes, the abandonment of this dependency would be impactful to the project. The project relies heavily on this dependency for parsing Markdown files, and while alternatives exist, switching to a different library would require significant effort.",

While this functionality is beneficial for reducing test execution time, it is not core to the primary functionality of the cypress-markdown-preprocessor, which is to use Markdown files as Cypress specs. Therefore, its importance to the project is moderate.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of cypress-split into the project is minimal. It is only referenced in the cypress.config.js file for setting up node events.
