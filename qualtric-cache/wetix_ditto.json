    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin is crucial for ensuring code quality and consistency in TypeScript projects. It provides specific linting rules for TypeScript, which are essential for maintaining a clean and error-free codebase. Given that the project uses TypeScript as a first-class citizen, the functionality provided by this dependency is highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin is integrated into the project's linting process, as indicated by the presence of eslint and @typescript-eslint/parser in the devDependencies. The plugin is likely used in the project's linting scripts to enforce TypeScript-specific rules. Replacing it would require finding an alternative that can seamlessly integrate with the existing eslint setup and provide equivalent TypeScript linting capabilities.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternatives to @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin, such as tslint, which was the standard for TypeScript linting before eslint became the preferred choice. However, tslint is now deprecated, and the ecosystem has largely moved to eslint with @typescript-eslint plugins. While there are other eslint plugins for TypeScript, they may not offer the same level of community support, rule coverage, or integration ease as @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. The TypeScript and eslint ecosystems are mature and stable, but changes in TypeScript or eslint could potentially impact the plugin's functionality. However, given the plugin's widespread use and active maintenance, such a scenario is less likely in the near term.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin to the project's code quality and the difficulty of replacing it with an equally effective alternative, its abandonment would be impactful. However, the likelihood of such an event is low, given the plugin's active maintenance and the stability of the TypeScript and eslint ecosystems.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The eslint-plugin-storybook provides best practice rules for Storybook, which is used in the project for developing UI components. While it enhances the development process by enforcing coding standards and best practices, the core functionality of the project (responsive UI components) does not directly depend on it. Therefore, its importance to the project is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of eslint-plugin-storybook is limited to the development environment, specifically for linting Storybook stories. It does not deeply integrate with the core functionality or the build process of the project. Replacing it would require updating the ESLint configuration but would not affect the project's main features or build process.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives available for linting Storybook stories, such as custom ESLint configurations or other ESLint plugins tailored for Storybook. These alternatives could provide similar functionality, making the replacement of eslint-plugin-storybook feasible.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The project's core functionality does not depend on eslint-plugin-storybook, and changes in the Storybook ecosystem are unlikely to directly impact the project's ability to maintain or develop its UI components.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of eslint-plugin-storybook to the project, its limited integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The tslib dependency is crucial for the project as it provides essential TypeScript helper functions. These functions are used to reduce the size of the emitted JavaScript files and decrease runtime overhead. Given that the project is built with TypeScript and Svelte, and considering the project's emphasis on TypeScript as a first-class citizen, the functionality provided by tslib is highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "tslib is deeply integrated into the project's build and development process. It is listed as a devDependency in the package.json file, indicating its use during the build process. The project's reliance on TypeScript for development means that tslib's helper functions are likely used extensively throughout the codebase. Replacing tslib would require significant changes to the build process and potentially the codebase itself.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to tslib, such as manually implementing the helper functions or using other libraries that provide similar functionality, these alternatives may not offer the same level of optimization and ease of use. tslib is specifically designed for TypeScript projects and is widely used in the TypeScript community, making it a preferred choice. Finding a suitable replacement that offers the same benefits would be challenging.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on tslib's abandonment is relatively low. tslib is maintained by Microsoft, which also maintains TypeScript, ensuring a high level of compatibility and support. However, if tslib were to be abandoned, it could lead to issues with future TypeScript updates or security vulnerabilities, necessitating action from the project maintainers.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of tslib to the project's build process and TypeScript integration, its abandonment would likely be impactful. The project relies on tslib for optimizing emitted JavaScript files and reducing runtime overhead, which are critical for performance. While the likelihood of abandonment is low, the potential impact on the project's development and maintenance processes is significant.",
