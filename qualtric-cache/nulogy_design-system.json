    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "TypeScript is crucial for the project as it is used for type checking and ensuring code quality across the entire codebase. The project's package.json lists TypeScript as a peer dependency, indicating its importance in the development environment. Additionally, TypeScript is integrated into the build process through rollup-plugin-typescript2 and is used in various configuration files and source code files, highlighting its essential role in the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "TypeScript is deeply integrated into the project, as evidenced by its use in the build configuration (rollup.config.js), linting configuration (.eslintrc), and throughout the source code. The project relies on TypeScript for type checking, and it is used in various components and utilities. Replacing TypeScript would require significant changes to the build process, linting rules, and potentially the source code itself, making it a difficult task.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to TypeScript, such as Flow or simply using JavaScript with JSDoc comments, these alternatives may not provide the same level of type safety and developer experience. TypeScript has become a de facto standard for type checking in the JavaScript ecosystem, and finding a suitable replacement that offers similar benefits would be challenging.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on TypeScript's abandonment is low. TypeScript is widely adopted and supported by Microsoft, making it unlikely to be abandoned in the near future. However, the JavaScript ecosystem is dynamic, and unforeseen changes could potentially impact the project's reliance on TypeScript.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role TypeScript plays in the project for type checking and ensuring code quality, its abandonment would be highly impactful. The deep integration of TypeScript into the build process, linting configuration, and source code, combined with the difficulty of finding a suitable replacement, underscores the potential impact of such an event.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency 'polished' is used in multiple components within the project for styling purposes, such as color manipulation and transparency effects. Given its widespread use across various components, it plays a significant role in the project's styling and visual consistency.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency 'polished' is integrated into the project's components through direct imports and usage in styled-components. Its functions are used for specific styling tasks, indicating a moderate level of integration. However, it does not appear to be deeply embedded in the core functionality of the components, suggesting that its replacement, while potentially time-consuming, would not be overly complex.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to 'polished' that offer similar functionality for styling in JavaScript, such as 'color' and 'tinycolor2'. These alternatives provide comparable features for color manipulation and could serve as suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacing 'polished'.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. 'Polished' is a well-maintained library with a stable API, and there are no immediate signs of it becoming abandoned. However, the dynamic nature of the JavaScript ecosystem means that this could change, though it is not currently a pressing concern.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of 'polished' to the project's styling, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of 'polished' would not likely be directly impactful to the project. However, it would require some effort to replace, especially in terms of updating the affected components.",
    "impactful": false

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The styled-components library is crucial for the project as it is used extensively throughout the codebase for styling components. It is listed as a peer dependency, indicating its importance in the project's architecture. The project's README also explicitly mentions the need to add styled-components to the project's dependencies, further emphasizing its significance.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "styled-components is deeply integrated into the project, as evidenced by its widespread usage across various components and utility files. The project uses styled-components for theming, component styling, and even for creating global styles. The depth of integration is high, making it a core part of the project's styling strategy.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to styled-components, such as Emotion or CSS Modules, replacing styled-components would require significant refactoring due to its deep integration and the specific features it provides (e.g., theming, tagged template literals). The availability of alternatives does not mitigate the difficulty of replacement.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While styled-components is widely used and maintained, the JavaScript ecosystem is volatile, and shifts in community preferences or the emergence of new, more efficient libraries could potentially lead to its abandonment.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role of styled-components in the project's styling strategy, its deep integration, and the significant effort required to replace it, the abandonment of styled-components would likely be directly impactful to the project. The project relies on styled-components for theming and component styling, and finding a suitable replacement that offers the same level of integration and features would be challenging.",
