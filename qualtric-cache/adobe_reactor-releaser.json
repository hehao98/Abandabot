    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The node-fetch dependency is used for making HTTP requests in the project, which is a fundamental part of the releaser tool's functionality. It is used in critical parts of the code, such as changing the availability of extensions and handling responses. Given its role in facilitating communication with external services, it is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "node-fetch is integrated into the project through a fetch wrapper class and is used in various test cases and functionalities. However, the integration does not appear to be deeply complex or spread across numerous files, suggesting that while it is important, replacing it might not be excessively difficult.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to node-fetch, such as axios and the native fetch API in newer versions of Node.js. These alternatives provide similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives makes replacing node-fetch less difficult.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the availability of alternatives and the relatively straightforward integration of node-fetch in the project, external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment are less likely. However, the importance of the functionality it provides means that any changes would still need to be addressed.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of node-fetch to the project's functionality, its integration level, the availability of alternatives, and the likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of node-fetch would be impactful but manageable. The project could transition to an alternative with some effort, but the core functionality would remain unaffected.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The `eslint-plugin-prettier` dependency is used to integrate Prettier with ESLint, ensuring code formatting consistency. While important for maintaining code quality, it is not critical to the core functionality of the Adobe Experience Platform Tags Extension Releaser Tool, which is to manage the release of extensions. The tool would still function without it, albeit with potentially less consistent code formatting.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of `eslint-plugin-prettier` is limited to the development environment, specifically within the linting process as indicated by the `lint` script in `package.json`. It does not deeply integrate into the core functionality or the runtime of the tool. Replacing it would primarily involve updating the linting configuration and potentially the CI/CD pipeline, but it would not require extensive changes to the codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to `eslint-plugin-prettier` that can integrate Prettier with ESLint, such as `prettier-eslint` and `eslint-config-prettier`. These alternatives provide similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace `eslint-plugin-prettier` if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. `eslint-plugin-prettier` is widely used and maintained by the Prettier team, which is a significant project in the JavaScript ecosystem. While abandonment is always a possibility, the current state of the project and its backing make it unlikely in the near term.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, the abandonment of `eslint-plugin-prettier` would not likely be directly impactful to the Adobe Experience Platform Tags Extension Releaser Tool. Its role is important but not critical to the tool's core functionality, it is not deeply integrated, there are viable alternatives, and the likelihood of abandonment is low. Therefore, it would not necessitate immediate action from the project maintainers.",
    "impactful": false
  },
  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The eslint-config-prettier dependency is used to disable ESLint rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier. This is crucial for maintaining code quality and consistency in the project, especially since the project involves JavaScript code that needs to be formatted according to Prettier's standards. However, its functionality, while important, is not directly tied to the core functionality of the Adobe Experience Platform Tags Extension Releaser Tool, which is more focused on the release process of Tags extensions.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of eslint-config-prettier in the project is straightforward and limited to the ESLint configuration. It does not deeply integrate with the project's core logic or functionality. Replacing or removing it would primarily involve changes to the ESLint configuration files, which is relatively simple and does not require extensive codebase modifications.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to eslint-config-prettier that can be used to achieve similar functionality, such as manually configuring ESLint rules to avoid conflicts with Prettier or using other ESLint plugins that offer similar features. The availability of these alternatives makes it easier to replace eslint-config-prettier if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The functionality provided by eslint-config-prettier is stable and well-established, and there are no immediate signs of it becoming abandoned. Additionally, the project's reliance on this dependency is not critical, making it less likely that its abandonment would have a significant impact.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance, integration depth, availability of alternatives, and likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of eslint-config-prettier would not likely be directly impactful to the Adobe Experience Platform Tags Extension Releaser Tool. Its role, while beneficial for code quality and consistency, is not critical to the core functionality of the project, and there are viable alternatives available.",
