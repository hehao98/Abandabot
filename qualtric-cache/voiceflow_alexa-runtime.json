    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency @voiceflow/voice-types provides essential type definitions for the project, which are used across multiple critical components such as handling no match scenarios, resuming programs, and AI responses. These type definitions are crucial for ensuring type safety and consistency throughout the codebase, especially in a complex project like alexa-runtime that handles Alexa requests and responses.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into several key parts of the project, including handlers for no match scenarios, program resumption, and AI responses. It is used to define types for nodes and models, which are fundamental to the project's operation. However, the integration is not deeply embedded in the core logic but rather serves as a supporting layer for type definitions.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "Given the specific nature of the types provided by @voiceflow/voice-types, which are tailored for Voiceflow's ecosystem, finding direct alternatives that offer the same level of specificity and integration might be challenging. However, the project could potentially define its own types or adapt types from other similar libraries, though this would require significant effort and might not be as seamless.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is relatively low. The dependency is specific to Voiceflow's ecosystem and does not directly interact with external services or APIs. However, changes in Voiceflow's internal standards or practices could indirectly impact the necessity of this dependency.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the dependency for type safety and consistency, the moderate level of integration, the challenge in finding suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @voiceflow/voice-types would likely be impactful to the project. The project relies on these type definitions for critical functionality, and replacing or removing them would require significant effort and could introduce risks.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency @voiceflow/git-branch-check is used for verifying git branch naming conventions, which is a non-critical task in the context of the alexa-runtime project. The core functionality of the project, which involves handling Alexa requests and generating responses, does not rely on this dependency. Therefore, its importance to the project is minimal.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @voiceflow/git-branch-check in the project is minimal. It is listed in the .depcheckrc file under the 'ignores' section, indicating that it is not directly used in the project's main codebase but rather as a development tool. Its removal or replacement would not affect the project's core functionality or its integration with other components.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available that can enforce git branch naming conventions, such as 'validate-branch-name' and 'git-branch-validator'. These alternatives can easily replace @voiceflow/git-branch-check without significant changes to the project's setup or workflow. The availability of these alternatives makes the replacement of the dependency straightforward.",

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the nature of the dependency as a development tool for enforcing git branch naming conventions, it is unlikely that external environmental changes will force the project to act on its abandonment. The project's core functionality is independent of this dependency, and its abandonment would not directly impact the project's operation or its ability to handle Alexa requests.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the minimal importance of the dependency to the project's core functionality, its low level of integration, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action on its abandonment, the abandonment of @voiceflow/git-branch-check would not be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Helmet is used to secure the Express app by setting various HTTP headers that help mitigate common web vulnerabilities. Given that the project, `alexa-runtime`, is a webhook service handling Alexa requests and responses, security is paramount. The functionality provided by Helmet is crucial for protecting the service from a range of web-based attacks, making it highly important to the project.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Helmet is integrated into the project as middleware in the Express app, specifically in the `backend/expressMiddleware.ts` file. Its integration is straightforward and limited to a single line of code where it is applied to the Express app. This indicates a shallow integration depth, making it relatively easy to replace or remove if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Helmet that can provide similar security functionalities, such as `express-security`, `secure-headers`, and custom middleware implementations. These alternatives can offer comparable security features, making it feasible to replace Helmet if needed. However, the ease of replacement would depend on the specific requirements and the chosen alternative's compatibility with the project.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Helmet's abandonment is low. Helmet is a well-maintained and widely used package in the Node.js ecosystem, with a strong community and regular updates. However, the possibility of unforeseen circumstances, such as a critical security vulnerability or a significant shift in web security standards, could necessitate action.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of Helmet in securing the Express app, its shallow integration depth, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of Helmet would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could relatively easily switch to an alternative security middleware without significant disruption.",
