    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Webpack is a core dependency for the project, as it is used to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser. The project's README indicates that the frontend dependencies are built using Webpack, which is essential for the development and production setup. Given its central role in the build process, the functionality provided by Webpack is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Webpack is deeply integrated into the project's build process, as indicated by the presence of Webpack-specific configurations and plugins in the package.json file. The project uses Webpack for both development and production builds, suggesting a high level of integration. Replacing Webpack would require significant changes to the build process and potentially the project structure.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to Webpack, such as Parcel or Rollup, they may not offer the same level of flexibility and plugin ecosystem that Webpack provides. Given the project's current setup and the specific Webpack plugins and loaders in use, finding a suitable alternative that matches all functionalities could be challenging.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Webpack's abandonment is relatively low, given Webpack's widespread use and active maintenance. However, the JavaScript ecosystem is fast-moving, and shifts in best practices or the emergence of a significantly better tool could increase this likelihood.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of Webpack to the project's build process, the depth of its integration, the challenges in finding suitable alternatives, and the current low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of Webpack would likely be directly impactful to the project.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The clean-webpack-plugin is used to clean the build directory before each build in production mode. This ensures that old files do not accumulate and potentially cause issues. While this functionality is useful, it is not critical to the core functionality of the project, which is managing alumni members. The project could still function without this plugin, albeit with potential build directory clutter.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The clean-webpack-plugin is integrated into the project's webpack configuration file (webpack.config.js) and is only used in production mode. Its integration is straightforward and limited to a single line of code. Replacing or removing this plugin would require minimal changes to the webpack configuration.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to clean-webpack-plugin, such as rimraf or del, which can be used to clean directories. These alternatives are well-maintained and could easily replace clean-webpack-plugin with minimal changes to the project's build process.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The clean-webpack-plugin is a utility plugin that does not directly interact with external systems or services. Its abandonment would not directly impact the project's functionality or its ability to interact with external systems.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the scores and reasoning provided for importance, integration, alternatives, and likelihood, the abandonment of clean-webpack-plugin would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The plugin provides a useful but non-critical functionality, is minimally integrated into the project, has readily available alternatives, and its abandonment would not be forced by external environmental changes.",

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The pug dependency is used for handling Vue SFC (Single File Components) templates in the project. Given that the project is a Django application with a frontend built using Vue.js, pug plays a crucial role in the templating and rendering of the frontend components. Its functionality is directly tied to the user interface and experience, making it highly important for the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Pug is integrated into the project through the webpack configuration, specifically for processing .pug files. The integration is relatively straightforward, as it is used in conjunction with pug-plain-loader for Vue SFCs. However, replacing it would require adjustments to the webpack configuration and potentially the Vue components themselves, indicating a moderate level of integration difficulty.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to pug for templating in Vue.js, such as plain HTML, Vue's own template syntax, and other templating engines like Handlebars or EJS. These alternatives could serve as suitable replacements, providing similar functionality. The availability of these alternatives makes the replacement of pug less difficult.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on pug's abandonment is relatively low. Pug is a well-established templating engine with a large user base and active maintenance. However, the JavaScript ecosystem is known for its rapid changes, and unforeseen circumstances could potentially impact pug's maintenance or compatibility with future versions of Vue.js or webpack.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of pug in the project for handling Vue SFC templates, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternative templating solutions, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of pug would likely not be directly impactful to the project. The project could transition to an alternative templating solution with manageable effort.",
