      "reasoning": "Rollup is used as the primary build tool for the Zaman project, as indicated by the 'build' script in the package.json file. The project relies on Rollup to bundle the React components into a distributable format. Given that the build process is a critical step in the development and deployment of the project, the functionality provided by Rollup is highly important.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Rollup is deeply integrated into the project's build process, as evidenced by the rollup.config.js file which configures how Rollup should bundle the project. The project uses several Rollup plugins for TypeScript, Babel, CommonJS, and minification, indicating a complex setup that would require significant effort to replace.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Rollup, such as Webpack, Parcel, and Vite, which could potentially serve as replacements. However, switching to an alternative would require reconfiguring the build process and potentially rewriting parts of the configuration to accommodate the differences in how these tools handle module bundling. This would be a non-trivial task, especially given the specific plugins and configurations currently in use.",

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Rollup is a widely used and actively maintained project with a large community and corporate backing, as indicated by the sponsors and contributors listed in its README. The likelihood of Rollup being abandoned in the near future is low. However, the JavaScript ecosystem is fast-moving, and changes in the ecosystem could potentially impact the relevance of Rollup.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role Rollup plays in the build process of the Zaman project, its abandonment would be highly impactful. The project would need to find a suitable replacement and reconfigure its build process, which would require significant effort. However, the likelihood of Rollup being abandoned is low, given its active maintenance and widespread use.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/jest package provides TypeScript definitions for Jest, which is a testing framework. While testing is crucial for maintaining code quality, the @types/jest package itself is not directly involved in the core functionality of the Zaman project, which is a React component for date picking. Therefore, its importance to the project's core functionality is relatively low.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/jest package is used in the development environment for testing purposes. It is not deeply integrated into the project's main codebase but is rather a part of the development and testing setup. Replacing it would not require significant changes to the project's core functionality.",

    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @types/jest for TypeScript definitions in testing frameworks, such as @types/mocha or @types/jasmine. These alternatives could serve as suitable replacements if needed. The availability of these alternatives makes the replacement of @types/jest relatively easy.",

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the abandonment of @types/jest is low. The TypeScript ecosystem is stable, and even if @types/jest were to be abandoned, the project could switch to another testing framework or continue using the existing definitions without immediate issues.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the low importance of @types/jest to the core functionality of the Zaman project, its minimal integration into the project's main codebase, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of @types/jest would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "ts-jest is crucial for the project as it allows testing TypeScript code with Jest. Given that the project is written in TypeScript, ts-jest ensures that the tests are correctly compiled and type-checked, which is essential for maintaining code quality and reliability.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "ts-jest is integrated into the project through the Jest configuration file (jest.config.ts), where it is specified as the transformer for TypeScript files. This integration is straightforward and limited to the testing setup, making it relatively easy to replace if necessary.",

    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternatives to ts-jest, such as babel-jest with the TypeScript preset, which can also compile TypeScript code for Jest tests.
