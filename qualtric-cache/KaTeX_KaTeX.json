    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The mini-css-extract-plugin is used to extract CSS into separate files, which is crucial for optimizing the loading of CSS/JS resources in production builds. Given that KaTeX is a library focused on rendering math on the web, the visual presentation (CSS) is as important as the functionality (JS). Therefore, the functionality provided by mini-css-extract-plugin is highly important for the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The mini-css-extract-plugin is integrated into the webpack configuration of KaTeX, specifically in the handling of CSS and SCSS files. It is used in both development and production configurations, indicating a deep integration. However, its usage is limited to the build process, and it does not directly affect the core functionality of KaTeX.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative plugins and methods for extracting CSS in webpack, such as the extract-text-webpack-plugin. However, mini-css-extract-plugin is recommended for webpack 5 due to its support for on-demand loading of CSS and source maps, and its performance benefits. While alternatives exist, they may not offer the same level of compatibility and features.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The mini-css-extract-plugin is a well-maintained project with a clear role in the webpack ecosystem. Changes in webpack or CSS handling standards could impact its relevance, but such changes are gradual and the project has shown adaptability in the past.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of CSS extraction for the project's production builds, the depth of integration in the webpack configuration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of mini-css-extract-plugin would be impactful but manageable. The project could transition to an alternative with some effort, but the immediate impact on production builds would be significant.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The rimraf package is used in the build process of KaTeX to clean up directories before building. While it is a useful utility, it is not core to the functionality of KaTeX itself, which is a math typesetting library. The primary functionality of KaTeX does not depend on rimraf, and the build process could be adjusted to use alternative methods for directory cleanup if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Rimraf is integrated into the build scripts of KaTeX, specifically in the 'clean' and 'dist:zip' scripts. Its usage is limited to these scripts, and it does not appear to be deeply integrated into the core codebase of KaTeX. Replacing rimraf in these scripts would require some effort but is feasible.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to rimraf for directory cleanup in Node.js projects, such as 'fs-extra' which is already a dependency in the project, or native Node.js 'fs' module methods. These alternatives could serve as suitable replacements with minimal changes to the build scripts.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on rimraf's abandonment is low. Rimraf is a stable and widely used package, and its abandonment would not directly impact the functionality of KaTeX. Any changes would likely be limited to the build process and could be managed without urgent action.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, rimraf's potential abandonment would not be directly impactful to the KaTeX project. Its role is limited to the build process, and there are viable alternatives available. The project could adapt to its absence with minimal disruption.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency `fs-extra` is used in the project for file system operations such as reading, writing, and copying files. These operations are crucial for tasks like updating subresource integrity hashes, building the website, and handling screenshots. However, the core functionality of KaTeX, which is math typesetting, does not directly depend on `fs-extra`. The dependency is more related to development and build processes rather than the runtime functionality of KaTeX.",

      "reasoning": "`fs-extra` is integrated into several scripts within the project, including `update-sri.js`, `website/lib/build.js`, and `dockers/screenshotter/screenshotter.js`. These scripts handle various build and development tasks. While `fs-extra` is used in multiple places, the integration is not deeply embedded into the core functionality of KaTeX. The dependency is primarily used for utility functions that could be replaced or refactored if necessary.",

    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to `fs-extra` that provide similar file system operations, such as `fs` (Node.js native module), `mkdirp`, `rimraf`, and `ncp`. These alternatives could be used to replace `fs-extra` with some refactoring of the code. However, `fs-extra` offers a convenient and unified API for these operations, which simplifies the code. The availability of alternatives makes it feasible to replace `fs-extra` if needed.",

While any package can potentially be abandoned, the risk is mitigated by the package's popularity and the availability of alternatives. The project could continue to use `fs-extra` even if it were no longer actively maintained, as long as it remains compatible with the Node.js version used by the project.",
      "score": 2
