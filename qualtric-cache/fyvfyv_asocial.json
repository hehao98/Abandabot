      "reasoning": "Webpack is a critical tool for the project as it is used to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser. The project's build script directly depends on Webpack, indicating its essential role in the build process. Given that the project is a browser extension, the functionality provided by Webpack is crucial for preparing the extension for deployment.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Webpack is deeply integrated into the project's build process, as evidenced by the 'build' script in the package.json file that directly calls Webpack with a specific configuration file. This suggests that Webpack's configuration and usage are tailored to the project's needs, making it a core part of the development workflow.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to Webpack, such as Parcel or Rollup, the project's current setup and configuration are specifically designed for Webpack. Switching to another bundler would require significant changes to the build process and potentially the project structure, making it a non-trivial task.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given Webpack's widespread use and active maintenance, the likelihood of it being abandoned in the near future is low. However, the JavaScript ecosystem is fast-evolving, and shifts in best practices or the emergence of a significantly better tool could potentially force a reconsideration of the project's dependency on Webpack.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the critical role Webpack plays in the project's build process, its deep integration, and the effort required to switch to an alternative, the abandonment of Webpack would be highly impactful to the project. However, the current low likelihood of abandonment mitigates the immediate risk.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The project 'asocial' uses stylelint as part of its development process, specifically for linting CSS files. Given that stylelint is a tool for enforcing conventions and avoiding errors in CSS, its functionality is crucial for maintaining code quality and consistency in the project's CSS files. However, since the project's main focus is on blocking feeds in social networks and not specifically on CSS, the direct impact of stylelint's functionality on the core functionality of the project is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of stylelint in the project appears to be minimal, with its usage confined to a script in the package.json file and a configuration file (.stylelintrc). This suggests that stylelint is not deeply integrated into the project's codebase, making it relatively easy to remove or replace if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to stylelint available, such as CSSLint and PostCSS, which can also lint CSS files and enforce coding standards. The availability of these alternatives makes it easier to replace stylelint if it becomes abandoned.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on stylelint's abandonment is low. Stylelint is a well-established tool with a large community and is unlikely to be abandoned suddenly. Even if it were to be abandoned, the project could continue using it for a significant period before needing to switch to an alternative.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of stylelint's functionality to the project, its minimal integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of stylelint would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",
    "impactful": false

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The eslint-plugin-promise enforces best practices for JavaScript promises, which is crucial for maintaining code quality and preventing common pitfalls in asynchronous code. Given that the project includes a script for running ESLint as part of its test suite, it's clear that code quality and adherence to best practices are important to the project. Therefore, the functionality provided by eslint-plugin-promise is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project's ESLint configuration, as indicated by its presence in the package.json file under devDependencies. However, replacing it would primarily involve updating the ESLint configuration file and possibly some code to comply with the rules of an alternative plugin. This suggests a moderate level of integration difficulty.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative ESLint plugins and configurations that can enforce best practices for JavaScript promises, such as eslint-plugin-import and eslint-config-standard. These alternatives could serve as suitable replacements, making the replacement of eslint-plugin-promise relatively straightforward.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The project's focus on blocking feeds in social networks is not directly dependent on the specifics of promise handling, and changes in the JavaScript ecosystem are unlikely to necessitate immediate action.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the functionality provided by eslint-plugin-promise to the project's code quality, the moderate difficulty of replacing it due to its integration into the ESLint configuration, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of eslint-plugin-promise would likely be impactful to the project. However, the impact is mitigated by the availability of alternatives and the project's ability to adapt to changes in the dependency.",
