    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Prettier is used for code formatting across the entire project, ensuring a consistent code style. This is crucial for maintaining code quality and readability, especially in a collaborative environment. The project's README explicitly mentions the use of Prettier for code formatting, indicating its importance in the development process.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Prettier is integrated into the project's development workflow through npm scripts and Git hooks, specifically for pre-commit formatting. This deep integration means that Prettier is automatically applied to code changes, making it a core part of the development process. Replacing Prettier would require significant changes to these workflows.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Prettier, such as ESLint (with formatting rules), StandardJS, and Beautify. However, Prettier's opinionated approach and wide adoption make it a preferred choice for many projects. While alternatives exist, finding one that matches Prettier's ease of use and integration might be challenging.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Prettier's abandonment is low. Prettier is widely used and actively maintained, reducing the risk of sudden abandonment. However, changes in the JavaScript ecosystem or the emergence of a significantly better tool could potentially impact its usage.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given Prettier's critical role in maintaining code quality and its deep integration into the project's development workflow, its abandonment would likely be impactful. However, the availability of alternatives and the low likelihood of sudden abandonment mitigate this impact to some extent.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @stylistic/eslint-plugin is used for enforcing stylistic rules in the codebase. While it contributes to code quality and consistency, it does not provide core functionality that is critical to the operation of the Luigi framework. Its role is more about maintaining code style rather than enabling key features or functionalities.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The plugin is integrated into the project's ESLint configuration files, specifically in `container/eslint.config.mjs` and `eslint.config.mjs`. It is used alongside other ESLint plugins and configurations. However, its integration is not deeply embedded into the core logic or functionality of the Luigi framework. Replacing it would primarily involve updating the ESLint configuration files.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative ESLint plugins and configurations available that can enforce stylistic rules in a codebase, such as `eslint-plugin-prettier` or `eslint-config-prettier`. These alternatives can provide similar functionality and are widely used in the JavaScript ecosystem. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace @stylistic/eslint-plugin.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The plugin is used for code style enforcement, which is not typically subject to external environmental changes. Additionally, the availability of alternatives reduces the risk of being forced to act due to abandonment.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the scores and reasoning provided for importance, integration, alternatives, and likelihood, the abandonment of @stylistic/eslint-plugin would not likely be directly impactful to the Luigi project. The plugin's role in enforcing code style, while beneficial, is not critical to the project's core functionality. Additionally, the ease of replacement and low likelihood of external environmental changes further reduce the potential impact.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Husky is used to manage Git hooks, specifically the pre-commit hook, which ensures code quality and formatting before commits. While this is important for maintaining code quality, it is not directly related to the core functionality of the Luigi framework, which is a micro frontend JavaScript framework. Therefore, the functionality provided by Husky is somewhat important but not critical to the project's main purpose.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Husky is integrated into the project's development workflow through the package.json file, specifically in the 'husky' section where it defines a pre-commit hook. This integration is straightforward and does not deeply intertwine with the core codebase of Luigi. Replacing Husky would require updating the Git hooks management but would not significantly impact the core functionality of Luigi.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Husky for managing Git hooks, such as pre-commit, Lefthook, and simple npm scripts. These alternatives can provide similar functionality and are relatively easy to integrate into the project. The availability of suitable alternatives makes replacing Husky less difficult.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Husky's abandonment is low. Git hooks management is a stable area with multiple alternatives, and changes in this area are unlikely to significantly impact the project.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance, integration depth, availability of alternatives, and likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of Husky would not likely be directly impactful to the Luigi project. Husky plays a role in maintaining code quality but is not critical to the core functionality of the framework. Additionally, the ease of finding and integrating alternatives further reduces the potential impact.",
