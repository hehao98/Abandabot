    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The passport-google-oauth20 dependency is used for authenticating users using Google accounts in the Habitica project. Given that Habitica is a habit-building program that likely requires user authentication for personalized experiences, the functionality provided by passport-google-oauth20 is crucial for enabling users to sign in with their Google accounts. This authentication method is a common and expected feature in modern web applications, making it important for user convenience and accessibility.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of passport-google-oauth20 in the Habitica project appears to be limited to the setupPassport.js file, where it is used to configure the Google authentication strategy. This suggests that the dependency is not deeply integrated into the project's codebase. However, authentication is a fundamental aspect of the application, and changes to this part of the code could have wide-reaching effects. Despite the limited integration points, the critical nature of authentication functionality makes the dependency's integration somewhat significant.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available for Google OAuth 2.0 authentication in Node.js applications, such as passport-google-oauth2 and google-auth-library. These alternatives provide similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements for passport-google-oauth20. The availability of these alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacing the dependency, although some adjustments to the authentication setup would be necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is relatively low. Google's OAuth 2.0 API is widely used and well-maintained, and there is no immediate indication that it will become deprecated or unsupported. However, changes in Google's API or security requirements could necessitate updates to the authentication strategy.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the passport-google-oauth20 dependency for user authentication, its integration into the project's authentication setup, the availability of alternative packages, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would likely be impactful to the project. However, the impact could be mitigated by the availability of alternative packages and the relatively straightforward process of updating the authentication strategy.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The remove-markdown dependency is used to strip Markdown formatting from text, specifically in the context of messages within the Habitica project. This functionality is important for ensuring that messages are displayed in a clean, readable format without Markdown syntax. However, the core functionality of Habitica, which is a habit-building program that treats life like a role-playing game, does not heavily rely on this feature. It is more of a convenience feature rather than a critical component of the application.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is used in a single location within the project, specifically in the message model to strip Markdown formatting from message text. This indicates a shallow integration with the project's codebase. Replacing or removing this dependency would require minimal changes to the codebase, primarily limited to the message model.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available that can strip Markdown formatting from text, such as 'strip-markdown' and 'markdown-to-text'. These alternatives provide similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements with minimal changes to the codebase. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace the remove-markdown dependency if necessary.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The functionality provided by remove-markdown is not critical to the core operation of Habitica, and there are no external factors that would necessitate immediate action if the dependency were to be abandoned. The project could continue to function without this dependency, albeit with slightly less convenience in message formatting.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, the abandonment of the remove-markdown dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the Habitica project. The functionality it provides is of low importance, it is minimally integrated into the project, there are readily available alternatives, and the likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action is low. Therefore, the dependency's abandonment would not significantly affect the project.",

      "reasoning": "Lodash is extensively used throughout the Habitica project for various utility functions such as data manipulation, array operations, and object handling. Its functionality is critical for the project's operations, as evidenced by its widespread usage in both the server and client-side code. The dependency is deeply integrated into the core functionalities, making it highly important for the project's stability and performance.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Lodash is deeply integrated into the Habitica project, with its methods being used in numerous files across the codebase. It is utilized in critical operations such as data manipulation, filtering, and sorting, which are essential for the application's functionality. The depth of its integration suggests that replacing Lodash would require significant refactoring of the codebase, affecting many parts of the application.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to Lodash, such as native JavaScript methods or other utility libraries like Ramda, the transition to these alternatives would not be straightforward. Lodash's API is widely used and understood, and its methods are optimized for performance. Finding a suitable replacement that offers the same level of functionality and performance would be challenging, and the migration process could introduce bugs and performance issues.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Lodash's abandonment is relatively low. Lodash is a mature and widely used library with a large community and active maintenance. However, the risk cannot be entirely ruled out, as any open-source project could potentially be abandoned or face significant changes that impact its users.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given Lodash's critical role in the Habitica project, its deep integration, and the challenges associated with finding and migrating to a suitable alternative, the abandonment of Lodash would likely be highly impactful. The project would face significant challenges in maintaining its current functionality and performance without Lodash, making it a dependency that is crucial to the project's success.",
