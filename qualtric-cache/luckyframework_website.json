    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The sass-loader is crucial for compiling SCSS/Sass files into CSS, which is essential for styling the Lucky's website. Given that the project uses SCSS for styling, the functionality provided by sass-loader is highly important for the project's appearance and user experience.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The sass-loader is integrated into the project's build process through webpack, as indicated by the package.json and the dependency's README. Replacing it would require changes to the webpack configuration and potentially the build process, indicating a moderate level of integration difficulty.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative packages available for compiling SCSS/Sass to CSS, such as node-sass and dart-sass. However, sass-loader is specifically designed for use with webpack, making it a preferred choice for projects using webpack. The availability of alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacement, but the specific integration with webpack adds some complexity.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The sass-loader is widely used and maintained, and there are no immediate signs of it becoming abandoned. However, the dynamic nature of the JavaScript ecosystem means that this could change, though it is not highly likely.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of sass-loader to the project's styling and build process, its integration with webpack, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of sass-loader would be impactful but not critically so. The project could transition to an alternative with some effort, but the process would not be trivial.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The modern-normalize dependency is used to normalize CSS across different browsers, ensuring consistency in the appearance of the website. While this is important for maintaining a consistent user experience, it is not a core functionality of the Lucky framework's website. The website could still function without it, albeit with potential inconsistencies in styling across browsers.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project via a single import statement in the app.scss file. This indicates a shallow level of integration, as there are no complex configurations or multiple points of usage throughout the codebase. Replacing or removing this dependency would require minimal changes to the project's code.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to modern-normalize, such as normalize.css and sanitize.css, which offer similar functionality. These alternatives are well-maintained and widely used in the industry, making them suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacing modern-normalize.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the nature of CSS normalization and the existence of multiple alternatives, it is unlikely that external environmental changes would force the project to act on the dependency's abandonment. The project could easily switch to an alternative without significant impact.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance, integration depth, availability of alternatives, and likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of modern-normalize would not likely be directly impactful to the Lucky framework's website. The dependency plays a role in ensuring consistent styling across browsers, but it is not critical to the website's core functionality, and there are several suitable alternatives available.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency highlight.js is used for syntax highlighting in the project, which is a key feature for a framework's website, especially one that provides guides and documentation. The project uses highlight.js to enhance the readability of code snippets across various programming languages. Given the nature of the project (a framework's website), the functionality provided by highlight.js is crucial for user experience and the educational value of the content.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of highlight.js in the project is moderate. It is imported and configured in the app.js file, where specific languages are registered for syntax highlighting. The usage is spread across multiple lines in app.js, indicating that it is integrated into the project's JavaScript build process. However, the integration does not appear to be deeply embedded into the core functionality of the project, suggesting that replacing it, while not trivial, would be manageable with some effort.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to highlight.js for syntax highlighting, such as Prism.js, CodeMirror, and Ace. These alternatives offer similar functionality and could potentially serve as suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacing highlight.js, as the project could transition to another syntax highlighter with comparable features.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on highlight.js's abandonment is low. Highlight.js is a widely used and actively maintained project with a large community and ecosystem. While the possibility of abandonment cannot be entirely ruled out, the current state of the project and its community support suggest that such a scenario is unlikely in the near future.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of syntax highlighting to the project's user experience and educational content, the moderate level of integration, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of highlight.js would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could transition to an alternative syntax highlighter with manageable effort, minimizing the impact on the project's functionality and user experience.",
