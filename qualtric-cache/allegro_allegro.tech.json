    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @material-ui/core package is a widely-used library for React components that follow Material Design principles. Given its extensive use in building user interfaces, it is likely that the project relies on it for a significant portion of its UI components. The absence of the project's README makes it difficult to assess the exact importance, but considering the package's popularity and the project's dependency on it, it is reasonable to assume that it plays a crucial role in the project's UI development.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @material-ui/core package is deeply integrated into the project, as indicated by its presence in the package.json file. The project likely uses it for various UI components, which would be spread throughout the codebase. Replacing it would require identifying and updating all instances where it is used, which could be a significant effort depending on the project's size and complexity.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @material-ui/core, such as Ant Design, Semantic UI, and Bootstrap for React. However, each of these alternatives has its own design philosophy and component set, which may not directly match Material Design principles. Migrating to an alternative would require not only replacing the components but also potentially redesigning parts of the UI to fit the new design system.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While @material-ui/core is a popular library with a large community and corporate backing, the open-source ecosystem is unpredictable. Changes in the maintainers' priorities, legal issues, or the emergence of a significantly better alternative could lead to its abandonment. However, given its current status, such a scenario is not imminent.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @material-ui/core to the project's UI development, the depth of its integration, the availability of alternatives, and the likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of this dependency would likely be impactful. The project would need to invest significant effort in finding and integrating a suitable replacement, which could affect development timelines and the overall user experience.",

      "reasoning": "TypeScript is listed as a devDependency in the package.json file, indicating it is used during the development process. However, the provided code snippet (next-env.d.ts) shows minimal usage, primarily for TypeScript configuration with Next.js. Given its role in development but limited explicit usage in the project's codebase, its importance is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of TypeScript in the project appears to be minimal, based on the provided code snippet. It is used for TypeScript configuration with Next.js, but there is no evidence of extensive TypeScript usage throughout the project. Therefore, replacing TypeScript would likely be straightforward, with minimal changes required to the project's codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to TypeScript for static type checking in JavaScript projects, such as Flow. However, TypeScript is widely adopted and supported, especially in the context of Next.js projects. While alternatives exist, the ecosystem and community support for TypeScript make it a preferred choice for many developers.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given TypeScript's widespread adoption and active development, the likelihood of it becoming abandoned in the near future is low. Additionally, the project's minimal reliance on TypeScript further reduces the impact of any potential abandonment.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, TypeScript's abandonment would have a low impact on the project. Its role is primarily in development, with minimal integration into the project's codebase. While there are alternatives, TypeScript's strong ecosystem and community support make it unlikely to be abandoned soon. Therefore, the dependency's abandonment would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

      "reasoning": "Sass is a widely used CSS preprocessor that enhances the functionality of CSS with features like variables, nested rules, and mixins. Given that the project's package.json includes Sass as a devDependency, it suggests that Sass is used for styling the project. The importance of Sass to the project is high because it significantly improves the maintainability and scalability of CSS code. However, without specific code snippets or a project README, it's challenging to assess the exact extent of Sass's role in the project.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Sass is listed as a devDependency in the package.json, indicating it's used during the development process, likely for compiling SCSS files into CSS. The integration depth is moderate because while it's essential for the development workflow, it doesn't directly affect the runtime behavior of the application. Replacing Sass would require finding an alternative CSS preprocessor and updating the build process accordingly.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Sass, such as Less, Stylus, and PostCSS, which offer similar functionalities. These alternatives are well-maintained and widely used in the industry, making it relatively easy to find a suitable replacement. However, transitioning to an alternative would require some effort to adjust the project's build process and possibly refactor the existing SCSS code.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Sass's abandonment is low. Sass is a mature and stable project with a large community and ecosystem. While any software project can potentially be abandoned, the risk of Sass being abandoned in the near future is minimal. However, the project should always be prepared for such scenarios by keeping dependencies up to date and considering alternatives.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of Sass to the project's development workflow, the moderate depth of its integration, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of its abandonment, the impact of Sass's hypothetical abandonment on the project would be moderate. While it would require some effort to replace Sass, the project could transition to an alternative CSS preprocessor without significant disruption.",
