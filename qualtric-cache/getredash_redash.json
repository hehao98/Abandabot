    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "@babel/preset-env is crucial for the project as it allows the use of the latest JavaScript features while ensuring compatibility with the target environments specified in the project's browserslist. This is essential for maintaining the project's modern codebase and ensuring it runs smoothly across different browsers and devices.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project's build process through its configuration in the .babelrc files. It is used in both the main client and the viz-lib, indicating a deep integration. However, Babel configurations are relatively modular, and replacing @babel/preset-env would primarily involve updating the Babel configuration files rather than making extensive changes to the codebase.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternatives to @babel/preset-env, such as directly specifying Babel plugins for the features needed or using other transpilers like TypeScript's tsc. However, @babel/preset-env is the most widely used and supported solution for this purpose, making it the preferred choice. Alternatives might require more manual configuration and could introduce compatibility issues.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. Babel is a cornerstone of the JavaScript ecosystem, and @babel/preset-env is one of its core packages. It is highly unlikely to be abandoned without a suitable replacement or migration path provided by the Babel team.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @babel/preset-env to the project's build process and compatibility strategy, its deep but modular integration, the availability of less optimal alternatives, and the low likelihood of forced action due to external changes, the abandonment of @babel/preset-env would be impactful but manageable. The project would need to find a replacement or adjust its build process, but the impact would be mitigated by the modular nature of Babel configurations and the availability of alternatives.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The style-loader is used to inject CSS into the DOM, which is a fundamental part of the project's frontend development process. Given that Redash is a data visualization tool, the presentation layer, including styles, is crucial for user experience. However, the functionality provided by style-loader is relatively straightforward and can be considered a utility rather than a core feature of the application.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The style-loader is integrated into the project's webpack configuration files, specifically for handling CSS and LESS files. It is used in both the main webpack configuration and the viz-lib configuration. While it is integrated into the build process, its role is limited to the development phase, as it is replaced by MiniCssExtractPlugin in production. This indicates a moderate level of integration.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to style-loader, such as MiniCssExtractPlugin, which is already used in the project for production builds. Other alternatives include isomorphic-style-loader and extract-text-webpack-plugin. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace style-loader if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The style-loader is a well-established package with a large user base, and its functionality is not likely to be affected by changes in the broader ecosystem. Additionally, the project already has a strategy in place for handling CSS in production, which reduces the impact of any potential abandonment.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance, integration, availability of alternatives, and likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of style-loader would not likely be directly impactful to the Redash project. The project already uses MiniCssExtractPlugin for production builds, and there are several alternatives available. The functionality provided by style-loader, while useful, is not critical to the core features of the application.",

      "reasoning": "The 'less' dependency is used extensively throughout the project for styling purposes, as evidenced by the numerous .less files and imports in the project. It is a core part of the project's styling system, which is crucial for the user interface and user experience. Therefore, the functionality provided by 'less' is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The 'less' dependency is deeply integrated into the project, with numerous components and pages importing and using .less files for styling. This widespread usage indicates that replacing 'less' would require significant changes across the codebase, affecting many components and pages.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to 'less' for CSS preprocessing, such as SASS/SCSS, PostCSS, and Stylus. These alternatives offer similar functionality and could potentially serve as suitable replacements. However, transitioning to an alternative would still require a significant effort to refactor the existing .less files and ensure compatibility.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While 'less' is a widely used and stable library, the JavaScript ecosystem is fast-moving, and shifts in community preferences or the emergence of new technologies could impact its usage. However, given its current stability and widespread adoption, such a scenario is not highly likely in the near term.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the extensive use of 'less' for styling throughout the project, its abandonment would likely be directly impactful. The dependency is deeply integrated into the project's codebase, and while there are alternatives, transitioning to them would require significant effort. Therefore, the abandonment of 'less' would be impactful to the project.",
