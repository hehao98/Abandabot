      "reasoning": "The @angular/core dependency is fundamental to the project as it is a core part of the Angular framework, which the project is built upon. It provides essential services and features like dependency injection, component lifecycle hooks, and more. The project's functionality heavily relies on Angular's core features, making this dependency highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @angular/core dependency is deeply integrated into the project's codebase. It is used across various components, services, and modules, including the main application module, service implementations, and component definitions. Replacing it would require a significant overhaul of the project's architecture and codebase.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are no direct alternatives to @angular/core that provide the same level of integration and functionality within the Angular ecosystem. While other frameworks like React or Vue exist, migrating to them would not be a straightforward replacement but rather a complete rewrite of the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given that Angular is a widely used and actively maintained framework by Google, the likelihood of @angular/core being abandoned is very low. The Angular team has a strong track record of supporting and updating the framework, making it unlikely that external environmental changes would force the project to act on the dependency's abandonment.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the critical role of @angular/core in the project, its deep integration, the lack of viable alternatives, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of this dependency would be highly impactful to the project. It would necessitate a significant effort to either find a replacement or rewrite the project using a different framework.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @angular/compiler is a core part of the Angular framework, responsible for compiling Angular templates and components. Given that the project 'ng-overlay-container' is an Angular library that provides overlay functionality, the @angular/compiler is crucial for the project's build process and runtime. Without it, the project cannot compile its Angular components, making it highly important.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @angular/compiler is deeply integrated into the Angular framework and the project's build process. It is used during the compilation of Angular templates and components, which is a fundamental part of the Angular application lifecycle. Replacing it would require significant changes to the project's build and runtime processes, making it highly difficult to replace.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are no direct alternatives to the @angular/compiler that provide the same functionality within the Angular ecosystem. While there are other JavaScript frameworks and libraries that offer similar features, they are not compatible with Angular's specific requirements and would require a complete rewrite of the project.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given that @angular/compiler is a core part of the Angular framework maintained by Google, the likelihood of it being abandoned is very low. Angular is widely used in the industry, and Google has a strong commitment to its development and maintenance.",

    },
    "reasoning": "The @angular/compiler is a critical dependency for the 'ng-overlay-container' project, as it is essential for compiling Angular templates and components. Its deep integration into the Angular framework and the project's build process makes it difficult to replace, and there are no suitable alternatives within the Angular ecosystem. However, the likelihood of it being abandoned is very low, given its importance to the Angular framework and Google's commitment to its maintenance.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The 'marked' dependency is used for parsing markdown content. Given the project's focus on creating overlays in Angular applications, the direct importance of markdown parsing to the core functionality of the project is minimal. It might be used for documentation or specific features that require markdown rendering, but it does not seem to be a critical component for the main functionality of the ng-overlay-container.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of 'marked' in the project appears to be minimal, as it is only referenced in the angular.json file for script inclusion. There is no evidence of deep integration within the project's core codebase or extensive usage in the application's logic. This suggests that replacing 'marked' would not require significant changes to the project's codebase.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available for markdown parsing in JavaScript, such as 'remark', 'markdown-it', and 'commonmark'. These alternatives offer similar or even enhanced functionality compared to 'marked'. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace 'marked' if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. 'marked' is a widely used and maintained library, and there is no immediate indication of it becoming abandoned. However, the open-source nature of the project means that this could change, but it is not a pressing concern.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the minimal importance of 'marked' to the core functionality of the ng-overlay-container, its shallow integration within the project, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of 'marked' would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",
