    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @angular-devkit/build-angular package is crucial for building and testing Angular applications. It provides the necessary builders for Angular CLI commands such as build, serve, and test. Given that the project is an Angular library, the functionality provided by this dependency is essential for the development and maintenance of the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @angular-devkit/build-angular package is deeply integrated into the project's build and test processes. It is used in the angular.json configuration file for building the library and the demo application, as well as for running tests. This deep integration makes it difficult to replace without significant changes to the project's configuration and build process.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternative build tools and test runners available for Angular applications, such as Webpack or Jest, replacing @angular-devkit/build-angular would require significant effort. The project would need to reconfigure its build and test processes, and there might be compatibility issues with Angular-specific features. Therefore, finding a suitable alternative that provides the same level of integration and functionality is challenging.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. Angular is a widely used framework with a large community and corporate backing, which reduces the risk of abandonment. However, changes in the Angular ecosystem or the deprecation of certain features could necessitate action.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @angular-devkit/build-angular to the project's build and test processes, its deep integration, the difficulty of finding suitable alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would likely be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency 'jasmine-core' is used for testing in the project. While testing is crucial for maintaining code quality and ensuring functionality, the core functionality of the project (file upload component) does not directly depend on 'jasmine-core'. Therefore, its importance to the project's main functionality is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of 'jasmine-core' in the project is limited to the testing environment. It is used in conjunction with other testing tools like Karma and Jasmine spec reporter. Replacing it would require adjustments in the testing setup but would not affect the main application code.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative testing frameworks available for JavaScript, such as Mocha, Jest, and QUnit. These alternatives provide similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements for 'jasmine-core'. The availability of these alternatives makes the replacement process less difficult.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. 'jasmine-core' is a well-established testing framework with a large community and active maintenance. However, the possibility of future changes in the JavaScript ecosystem or testing practices could impact this.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, 'jasmine-core' is important for the project's testing environment but not critical to its core functionality. The integration depth is limited to testing, and there are several viable alternatives available. The likelihood of external changes forcing action on this dependency's abandonment is low. Therefore, the abandonment of 'jasmine-core' would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

      "reasoning": "Protractor is used for end-to-end testing in the project. While testing is crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of the application, the core functionality of the project (file upload component) does not directly depend on Protractor. Therefore, its importance to the project's main functionality is moderate.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Protractor is integrated into the project as a devDependency and is used for end-to-end testing. The integration is not deeply embedded into the core functionality of the project but is rather a part of the development and testing process. Replacing Protractor would require updating the testing scripts and possibly the test cases, but it would not affect the main application logic.",

    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Protractor for end-to-end testing in Angular applications, such as Cypress, TestCafe, and Nightwatch.js. These alternatives provide similar functionalities and could serve as suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace Protractor.",

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Protractor's abandonment is low. Protractor is a well-established tool with a large community and is maintained by the Angular team. While the possibility of abandonment exists, it is not highly likely in the near future.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance, integration, alternatives, and likelihood of abandonment, Protractor's abandonment would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project can continue to function without Protractor, and there are suitable alternatives available for end-to-end testing.",
