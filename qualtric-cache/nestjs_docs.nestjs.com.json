    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @angular/common package is a core part of the Angular framework, providing essential services and directives that are used throughout the project. It is imported in multiple modules and components, indicating its widespread use and importance in the project's functionality. Given its role in enabling Angular's core features, its abandonment would significantly impact the project's ability to function as intended.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "@angular/common is deeply integrated into the project, as evidenced by its use in multiple modules and components across the application. It is used for common directives, pipes, and services that are fundamental to Angular applications. Replacing it would require extensive refactoring of the codebase to remove or replace its usage, which would be a complex and time-consuming process.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to @angular/common, such as other UI libraries or custom implementations, none provide the same level of integration and compatibility with Angular. Finding a suitable replacement that offers the same functionality and fits seamlessly into the Angular ecosystem would be challenging. Additionally, the effort to migrate to an alternative would be significant, given the depth of @angular/common's integration in the project.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on @angular/common's abandonment is moderate. While Angular is a widely used and supported framework, the open-source nature of @angular/common means that its maintenance could potentially cease. However, given its importance to the Angular ecosystem, it is more likely that the Angular team or the community would step in to maintain it, reducing the risk of abandonment.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the critical role of @angular/common in the project, its deep integration, the challenges in finding suitable alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of @angular/common would likely be directly impactful to the project. It would require significant effort to mitigate, affecting the project's functionality and development timeline.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @eslint/js package is used to enforce coding standards and best practices in the project. While important for maintaining code quality, the core functionality of the NestJS documentation project does not directly depend on it. It is more of a development tool rather than a critical runtime dependency.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @eslint/js is minimal, as it is only referenced in the eslint.config.js file to extend the recommended rules. This suggests that replacing it would not require extensive changes to the project's codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @eslint/js, such as TSLint or Prettier, which can also enforce coding standards. The availability of these alternatives makes it easier to replace @eslint/js if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. ESLint is a widely used tool with a large community, making it unlikely to be abandoned without notice or alternatives.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the minimal integration, availability of alternatives, and low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of @eslint/js would not likely be directly impactful to the NestJS documentation project. It serves more as a development tool rather than a critical runtime dependency.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The 'marked' dependency is used extensively throughout the project for rendering markdown content into HTML. It is integrated into various renderers and services that handle the transformation of documentation content. Given that the project is a documentation site for NestJS, the ability to render markdown is crucial for displaying the documentation correctly. Therefore, the functionality provided by 'marked' is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The 'marked' dependency is deeply integrated into the project's codebase. It is used in multiple renderers and services, including code, table, blockquote, heading, and link renderers. The project has custom renderers that extend 'marked's functionality, indicating a deep integration. Replacing 'marked' would require significant refactoring of these custom renderers and services.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative markdown parsers available, such as 'remark', 'markdown-it', and 'commonmark'. These alternatives offer similar functionality and could potentially serve as replacements for 'marked'. However, switching to an alternative would require adapting the project's custom renderers and services to work with the new parser, which could be time-consuming but feasible.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on 'marked's abandonment is moderate. While 'marked' is a widely used and maintained library, the JavaScript ecosystem is dynamic, and dependencies can become abandoned or deprecated. However, given 'marked's popularity and active maintenance, the risk of abandonment in the near future is relatively low.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of 'marked' to the project's functionality, its deep integration into the codebase, the availability of alternative markdown parsers, and the relatively low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of 'marked' would likely be impactful to the project. The project would need to invest significant effort to replace 'marked' with an alternative, but it is feasible.",
