    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The jsonpath dependency is used in multiple critical parts of the project, including configuration management and Kubernetes deployment scripts. It is essential for querying and manipulating JSON data within the project, which is a core functionality for a framework that deals with model-driven applications and cloud-native deployments.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "jsonpath is deeply integrated into the project's codebase, with usage in core services, configuration management, and deployment scripts. Replacing it would require significant refactoring across multiple files and components, making the integration depth quite high.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to jsonpath, such as jmespath or custom JSON querying functions, finding a drop-in replacement that matches jsonpath's syntax and functionality exactly could be challenging. The project's reliance on specific jsonpath features increases the difficulty of finding a suitable alternative.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the dependency's active maintenance and widespread use in the JavaScript ecosystem, the likelihood of it being abandoned in the near future is low. However, external environmental changes, such as security vulnerabilities or significant shifts in the ecosystem, could force the project to act.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the critical role of jsonpath in the project's functionality, the depth of its integration, and the challenges in finding a suitable alternative, the abandonment of jsonpath would likely be impactful to the project. However, the current low likelihood of abandonment mitigates the immediate risk.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Husky is used in the project to manage Git hooks, specifically for pre-commit, commit-msg, and pre-push tasks. These tasks include running tests, linting, and commit message validation. While these are important for maintaining code quality and consistency, they are not core to the functionality of the Webda framework itself. Therefore, the functionality provided by Husky is important but not critical to the project's core operations.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Husky is integrated into the project through Git hooks, which are defined in the .husky directory. The integration is straightforward and limited to these hooks. Replacing Husky would require finding an alternative way to manage these Git hooks, which could be done with other tools or custom scripts. The integration depth is moderate, as it affects the development workflow but not the application's runtime behavior.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Husky for managing Git hooks, such as pre-commit, lefthook, and simple custom scripts. These alternatives can provide similar functionality and could be used as replacements. The availability of suitable alternatives makes it less difficult to replace Husky.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Husky's abandonment is low. Husky is a widely used tool with a large community, and its abandonment would likely be gradual, giving the project time to adapt. Additionally, the project's reliance on Husky is not so deep that it would be immediately impacted by its abandonment.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of Husky to the project's development workflow, the moderate depth of its integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of Husky would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could adapt by using alternative tools or custom scripts to manage Git hooks.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The eslint-config-prettier dependency is used to disable ESLint rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier. Given that the project uses Prettier for code formatting, ensuring that ESLint and Prettier work together without conflicts is crucial for maintaining code quality and developer productivity. However, the functionality provided by eslint-config-prettier is relatively narrow and focused, primarily serving as a bridge between ESLint and Prettier.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of eslint-config-prettier in the project is minimal. It is included in the ESLint configuration file (eslint.config.js) and is used to ensure that Prettier's formatting rules do not conflict with ESLint's rules. The dependency is not deeply integrated into the project's codebase, and its removal or replacement would not require significant changes to the project's code.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to eslint-config-prettier that can achieve similar functionality, such as eslint-plugin-prettier, which integrates Prettier directly into ESLint. Additionally, the project could manually disable conflicting ESLint rules without relying on a specific package. The availability of alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace eslint-config-prettier if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The functionality provided by eslint-config-prettier is stable and well-established, and there is a low risk of significant changes in the ecosystem that would necessitate immediate action. However, the project should monitor the dependency's status and be prepared to switch to an alternative if the dependency becomes abandoned.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance, integration, alternatives, and likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of eslint-config-prettier would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The dependency serves a specific and relatively narrow purpose, and there are viable alternatives available. The project could continue to function effectively even if the dependency were to be abandoned, with minimal effort required to switch to an alternative solution.",
