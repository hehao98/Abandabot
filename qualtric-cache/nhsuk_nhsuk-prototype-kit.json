    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Express is a core dependency for the NHS prototype kit, providing the web framework that enables the creation of interactive prototypes. It is used extensively throughout the project for routing, middleware, and serving static assets. Given its central role in the project's functionality, its importance is high.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Express is deeply integrated into the project, with its usage spanning across multiple files including the main application file (app.js), middleware, and routes. It is used for setting up the server, routing, and serving static files. Replacing Express would require significant refactoring of the codebase.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternative frameworks to Express (e.g., Koa, Fastify), finding a suitable replacement that matches Express's feature set, community support, and ease of integration would be challenging. The project's reliance on Express-specific features and middleware further complicates the replacement process.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given Express's widespread use, active maintenance, and strong community support, the likelihood of it being abandoned in the near future is low. However, external factors such as significant shifts in the Node.js ecosystem or the emergence of a superior framework could potentially impact its status.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the critical role Express plays in the NHS prototype kit, its deep integration into the project, the challenges associated with finding and integrating a suitable alternative, and the low likelihood of its abandonment, the hypothetical abandonment of Express would be highly impactful to the project.",
    "impactful": true

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @babel/core dependency is crucial for the project as it is used for transpiling modern JavaScript into a version compatible with older browsers. This ensures that the prototype kit can be used across a wide range of environments, which is essential for its purpose of enabling interactive prototypes that look like NHS.UK pages. Given the project's reliance on modern JavaScript features for development efficiency and user experience, the functionality provided by @babel/core is highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "@babel/core is integrated into the project through the build process, specifically in the 'gulp build' task which uses 'gulp-babel' for transpilation. This indicates a deep integration into the project's build and development workflow. Replacing @babel/core would require significant changes to the build process and potentially the project's codebase to accommodate a different transpiler or to remove the need for transpilation altogether.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @babel/core for JavaScript transpilation, such as TypeScript's tsc, esbuild, and swc. These alternatives offer similar functionality and could potentially serve as suitable replacements. However, transitioning to an alternative would require evaluating compatibility, performance, and community support, as well as making necessary adjustments to the build process and possibly the codebase.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on @babel/core's abandonment is moderate. While the JavaScript ecosystem is dynamic, @babel/core is a widely used and supported tool. However, changes in browser standards or the emergence of new, more efficient transpilation tools could increase the pressure to switch.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @babel/core to the project's build process and the availability of alternatives, the abandonment of @babel/core would be impactful but not critically so. The project could transition to an alternative transpiler, though this would require effort and resources. Therefore, while the abandonment would be noteworthy, it would not be directly impactful to the project's core functionality.",
    "impactful": false

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dotenv package is used to load environment variables from a .env file into process.env. This functionality is crucial for managing configuration settings, such as API keys and database credentials, in a secure and environment-specific manner. Given that the NHS prototype kit is a tool for creating interactive prototypes that may require various configurations, the ability to manage these settings securely and efficiently is highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of dotenv in the project is minimal but essential. It is used at the very beginning of the app.js file to ensure that environment variables are loaded before any other code runs. This indicates that while the integration is not deeply embedded across the codebase, it plays a critical role in the application's setup and configuration process.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to dotenv that provide similar functionality, such as dotenv-expand, dotenvx, and custom solutions for managing environment variables. These alternatives offer various features, including variable expansion, encryption, and support for multiple environments. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace dotenv if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. dotenv is a widely used and well-maintained package with a strong community support. However, the possibility of future changes in Node.js or the ecosystem that could affect dotenv's functionality cannot be entirely ruled out.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of dotenv for managing environment variables, its minimal but essential integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of dotenv would not likely be directly impactful to the NHS prototype kit project. The project could relatively easily switch to an alternative solution if needed.",
