    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @cosmjs/math dependency is used in multiple critical parts of the project, including handling version numbers, gas calculations, and contract instantiation. Its functionality is essential for the correct operation of the project, especially in areas related to transaction processing and contract management.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is deeply integrated into the project, with its usage spread across various modules including transaction signing, contract management, and query handling. Replacing it would require significant changes to the codebase, affecting multiple functionalities.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are other libraries available for mathematical operations in JavaScript, @cosmjs/math is specifically designed for blockchain and cryptographic applications, making it uniquely suited for the project's needs. Finding a replacement that offers the same level of integration and functionality could be challenging.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the specialized nature of @cosmjs/math and its critical role in blockchain applications, it is unlikely that external environmental changes would force the project to act on its abandonment. However, the dependency is part of the @cosmjs suite, which is widely used in the Cosmos ecosystem, so changes in the ecosystem could indirectly affect its status.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the critical role of @cosmjs/math in the project, its deep integration, the lack of direct alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would be highly impactful to the project. It is essential for transaction processing, contract management, and other core functionalities, making its maintenance crucial for the project's success.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency `fs-extra` is used in the project for file system operations, specifically for writing files. Given the project's nature as a Cyber client API library, file system operations are not its core functionality. However, the usage of `fs-extra` in the provided code snippets is for writing JSON files, which could be part of data export or logging features. While not central to the project's main purpose, file system operations are still important for these auxiliary features.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of `fs-extra` in the project appears to be minimal, with only a few lines of code using it for writing files. This suggests that `fs-extra` is not deeply integrated into the project's codebase. Replacing it would likely require minimal changes, primarily in the file writing logic.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to `fs-extra` that provide similar file system operation functionalities, such as the native `fs` module with additional utility libraries or other npm packages like `graceful-fs`. These alternatives could serve as suitable replacements with minimal adjustments to the code.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on `fs-extra`'s abandonment is low. The project's core functionality does not heavily rely on `fs-extra`, and there are viable alternatives available. Additionally, `fs-extra` is a widely used and maintained package, reducing the risk of sudden abandonment.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, `fs-extra` is used for auxiliary file system operations in the project, with minimal integration and available alternatives. Its abandonment would not likely be directly impactful to the project's core functionality.",
    "impactful": false

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "TypeScript is crucial for the project as it is used for type checking and compiling the code. The project's build script directly uses TypeScript ('tsc'), and the project's .eslintrc.js file is configured to work with TypeScript, indicating deep integration of TypeScript in the development process.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "TypeScript is deeply integrated into the project's development workflow, as evidenced by the use of TypeScript-specific ESLint rules and the direct use of 'tsc' in the build script. The project's codebase is written in TypeScript, and the ESLint configuration is tailored for TypeScript, indicating a high level of integration.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to TypeScript, such as Babel for JavaScript compilation or Flow for type checking, TypeScript is the most widely adopted solution for type checking in the JavaScript ecosystem. Replacing TypeScript would require significant changes to the project's build process and potentially the codebase itself, as the project is heavily reliant on TypeScript's features.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of TypeScript being abandoned is very low, given its widespread adoption and active maintenance by Microsoft. However, if TypeScript were to be abandoned, it would force the project to find an alternative solution for type checking and compilation, which could be a significant undertaking.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the deep integration of TypeScript in the project's development workflow and its importance for type checking and compilation, the abandonment of TypeScript would be highly impactful. However, the likelihood of TypeScript being abandoned is very low.",
