    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @2600hz/sds-core dependency is used in multiple SCSS files within the project, indicating it provides essential styling utilities and tools. The project relies on it for defining variables and tokens that are used across different components, such as selection lists, radio buttons, and badges. This suggests that the functionality provided by @2600hz/sds-core is crucial for maintaining the visual consistency and theming of the Monster UI framework.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is deeply integrated into the project's SCSS files, as evidenced by the @import statements in multiple partials. These imports are used to access core styling tools and variables, which are then utilized throughout the project's stylesheets. Replacing this dependency would require updating all these imports and potentially refactoring the styles that depend on its variables and tools, indicating a high level of integration.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are many CSS and SCSS libraries available that offer similar functionality, finding a direct replacement that matches the specific needs and conventions of the Monster UI framework could be challenging. The project's reliance on specific variables and tools provided by @2600hz/sds-core means that any alternative would need to be carefully evaluated for compatibility and might require significant adjustments to the project's stylesheets.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is relatively low, as the dependency is specific to the 2600Hz ecosystem and is maintained by the same organization. However, if the dependency were to be abandoned, it could pose a significant risk to the project's ability to maintain and update its styling, given the dependency's deep integration and importance.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role of @2600hz/sds-core in providing essential styling utilities and its deep integration into the project's SCSS files, its abandonment would likely have a significant impact on the Monster UI framework. The project would face challenges in maintaining visual consistency and theming, and finding a suitable replacement would require considerable effort. Therefore, the abandonment of this dependency would be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The gulp-cached dependency is used in the project to cache files during the build process, which helps in optimizing the build by only processing files that have changed. This functionality is important for development efficiency, especially in a large project like monster-ui where frequent builds are common. However, it is not a core functionality that the project cannot operate without, as the build process can still function without caching, albeit less efficiently.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "gulp-cached is integrated into the build process, specifically in the server.js task file, where it is used to cache HTML, JS, and JSON files. Its integration is moderate; it is used in multiple places within a single task file, but it does not appear to be deeply embedded across the entire codebase. Replacing it would require modifications to the build tasks but would not necessitate a complete overhaul of the project's build system.",
      "score": 3

    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to gulp-cached that provide similar caching functionality for gulp tasks, such as gulp-remember and gulp-newer. These alternatives could serve as suitable replacements with minimal changes to the existing code. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace gulp-cached.",

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. gulp-cached is a utility tool that does not directly interact with external systems or APIs. Its abandonment would not directly impact the project's functionality or its ability to interact with external services.",

    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of gulp-cached to the project's build efficiency, its moderate level of integration, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of gulp-cached would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could continue to function and build without it, albeit less efficiently, and could transition to an alternative with relative ease.",

      "reasoning": "The gulp-rename plugin is used for renaming files within the gulp build process. While it provides a useful utility, its functionality is not critical to the core operations of the Monster UI project. The project could potentially work around the absence of this plugin by manually renaming files or using alternative methods within the gulp tasks. Therefore, its importance to the project is moderate.",

      "reasoning": "gulp-rename is integrated into the gulp build process, which is a fundamental part of the project's development workflow. However, its usage is likely limited to specific tasks within the gulpfile.js, and it does not deeply integrate into the core logic of the application. Replacing or removing it would require adjustments to the gulp tasks but would not necessitate extensive changes to the project's codebase.",
