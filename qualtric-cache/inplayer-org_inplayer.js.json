      "reasoning": "The eslint-plugin-import is used for linting ES2015+ import/export syntax, which is crucial for maintaining code quality and preventing issues with misspelling of file paths and import names. Given that the project is a JavaScript SDK, maintaining high code quality is essential. Therefore, the functionality provided by eslint-plugin-import is highly important to the project.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of eslint-plugin-import in the project is moderate. It is listed as a devDependency in the package.json and is used in the linting process, as indicated by the 'lint' script. However, it does not appear to be deeply integrated into the core functionality of the SDK itself, but rather is part of the development toolchain.",

    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to eslint-plugin-import, such as eslint-plugin-node, eslint-plugin-jsdoc, and others that can handle module import/export syntax. However, eslint-plugin-import is widely used and has a comprehensive set of rules specifically designed for ES2015+ import/export syntax, making it a preferred choice. Finding a replacement with the same level of functionality and community support might be challenging.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. eslint-plugin-import is a well-established plugin with a large user base and active maintenance. However, the JavaScript ecosystem is fast-moving, and changes in the ecosystem or in the project's requirements could potentially necessitate a change.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of maintaining high code quality in a JavaScript SDK, the functionality provided by eslint-plugin-import is crucial. While it is not deeply integrated into the core functionality of the SDK, it plays a significant role in the development process. The availability of alternatives is somewhat limited, and the likelihood of being forced to act due to external changes is low. Therefore, the abandonment of eslint-plugin-import would likely be impactful to the project.",

      "reasoning": "Prettier is used as a code formatting tool in the project, which is important for maintaining code consistency and readability. However, it is not directly involved in the core functionality of the InPlayer JavaScript SDK, which is the main focus of the project. Therefore, while important, its role is more supportive rather than critical.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Prettier is integrated into the project's linting process through the .eslintrc configuration. It is used in conjunction with ESLint to enforce code formatting rules. The integration is straightforward and primarily involves configuration settings rather than deep code-level integration.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative code formatting tools available that could serve as suitable replacements for Prettier, such as ESLint's built-in formatting rules, StandardJS, or Beautify. These alternatives can provide similar functionality, making it relatively easy to replace Prettier if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Prettier's abandonment is low. Code formatting tools are generally stable and do not frequently undergo significant changes that would necessitate immediate action. Additionally, the project's reliance on Prettier is not so critical that its abandonment would cause significant disruption.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Prettier plays a supportive role in the project by ensuring code consistency and readability through formatting. While it is important for maintaining code quality, it is not critical to the core functionality of the InPlayer JavaScript SDK. The integration of Prettier is straightforward, and there are several viable alternatives available. The likelihood of external changes forcing the project to act on Prettier's abandonment is low. Therefore, the abandonment of Prettier would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

      "reasoning": "Axios is used extensively throughout the project for making HTTP requests. It is imported and utilized in multiple files, including the main request factory, various models, and endpoints. The project relies on Axios for handling all HTTP communication, making it a critical dependency.",

    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Axios, such as Fetch API, SuperAgent, and Request. However, Axios is widely used and well-supported, with features like request and response interception, automatic JSON data transformation, and client-side XSRF protection. While alternatives exist, Axios's feature set and community support make it a strong choice, and switching would require significant effort.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given Axios's popularity and active maintenance, the likelihood of it being abandoned is low. However, if it were to be abandoned, the project would need to find an alternative HTTP client, which could be challenging due to Axios's deep integration and the need to replicate its features.",

While there are alternatives, Axios's feature set and community support make it a strong choice. The likelihood of Axios being abandoned is low, but if it were, the project would face significant challenges in finding and integrating a suitable replacement. Given its importance and integration, the abandonment of Axios would likely be impactful to the project.",
