      "reasoning": "Webpack is a core tool used in the project for bundling JavaScript files, as indicated by the project's README and package.json. The project relies on Webpack for building the extension, which is a critical part of the development workflow. The functionality provided by Webpack is essential for the project's build process, making it highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Webpack is deeply integrated into the project's build process, as evidenced by the webpack.config.js file and the npm scripts in package.json. The project uses Webpack for both development and production builds, indicating a significant level of integration. Replacing Webpack would require a substantial rewrite of the build process and configuration.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to Webpack, such as Parcel or Rollup, they may not offer the same level of flexibility and plugin ecosystem. The project's current setup and configuration are tailored to Webpack, and switching to an alternative would require significant effort to achieve the same functionality and performance.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given Webpack's widespread use and active maintenance, the likelihood of it being abandoned in the near future is low. However, if external environmental changes, such as a shift in the JavaScript ecosystem or the emergence of a superior bundling tool, were to occur, the project might need to consider alternatives.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of Webpack to the project's build process, its deep integration, the effort required to replace it, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of Webpack would be highly impactful to the project. The project would face significant challenges in maintaining its build process and ensuring compatibility with future updates or changes in the ecosystem.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Husky is used in the project to manage Git hooks, specifically the pre-commit hook which checks code formatting before allowing a commit. This functionality is important for maintaining code quality and consistency across the project. However, it is not critical to the core functionality of the Prettierlichess extension itself, which is to enhance the Lichess platform's appearance. Therefore, while important, it is not the most critical dependency.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Husky is integrated into the project through a pre-commit hook script located in the .husky directory. The integration is straightforward and limited to this single use case. Replacing Husky would require modifying or replacing this script, but given its limited scope, the effort required would be relatively low.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Husky for managing Git hooks, such as pre-commit, lefthook, and simple-git-hooks. These alternatives offer similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace Husky if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Husky's abandonment is low. Husky is a well-maintained project with a large user base, and there is no immediate indication that it will be abandoned. Additionally, the project's use of Husky is not tied to any external services or APIs that could change.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of Husky to the project, its level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of Husky would not likely be directly impactful to the Prettierlichess project. The functionality provided by Husky, while useful, is not critical to the core operation of the extension, and there are viable alternatives available.",

      "reasoning": "The mime package is used in the project to determine the MIME type of files being served by the popup server. This functionality is crucial for correctly serving files with the appropriate content type headers, which is essential for the proper functioning of web applications. However, the usage is limited to a specific part of the project (testing/popupServer.js), and it does not seem to be deeply integrated into the core functionality of the Prettierlichess extension.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The mime package is used in a single file (testing/popupServer.js) to determine the MIME type of files being served. This indicates a shallow integration into the project's codebase. Replacing the mime package in this context would likely require minimal changes, primarily within the popup server's file handling logic.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available that can determine MIME types, such as 'mime-types' and 'file-type'. These alternatives offer similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements with minimal adjustments to the code. The availability of these alternatives makes the replacement of the mime package relatively straightforward.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The mime package is used for a specific, non-core functionality (determining MIME types for a testing server), and there are no indications that this functionality will be affected by external changes. Additionally, the availability of alternative packages reduces the risk of being forced to act due to abandonment.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the limited and non-core usage of the mime package in the project, the availability of alternative packages, and the shallow integration of the package into the project's codebase, the abandonment of the mime package would not likely be directly impactful to the Prettierlichess project. The project could easily switch to an alternative package with minimal effort, and the core functionality of the extension would remain unaffected.",
