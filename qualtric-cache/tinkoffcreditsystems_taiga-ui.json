    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @angular/core package is fundamental to the Taiga UI project as it is an Angular UI Kit. The project's README explicitly states that it is 'fully-treeshakable Angular UI Kit consisting of multiple base libraries and several add-ons.' This indicates that @angular/core is not just a dependency but the backbone of the entire project, providing essential Angular functionalities. Without @angular/core, the project cannot function as it relies on Angular's core features for building and running the UI components.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @angular/core in the Taiga UI project is deep and pervasive. The provided code snippets and dependency usage overview show that @angular/core is used across various components, directives, and services within the project. It is imported in numerous files, indicating that it is integral to the project's architecture. Replacing @angular/core would require a complete overhaul of the project's codebase, as it is tightly coupled with Angular's core functionalities.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are no direct alternatives to @angular/core that provide the same level of integration and functionality for an Angular-based project. While other frameworks like React or Vue exist, they are not compatible with Angular's ecosystem and would require a complete rewrite of the project. Within the Angular ecosystem, @angular/core is unique and irreplaceable for projects built on Angular.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on @angular/core's abandonment is low. Angular is a widely used and actively maintained framework by Google, and @angular/core is its core package. The Angular team has a strong commitment to backward compatibility and long-term support. However, in the unlikely event of Angular's abandonment, the project would face significant challenges, but this scenario is highly improbable given Angular's current position in the market.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role of @angular/core in the Taiga UI project, its deep integration, the lack of viable alternatives, and the low likelihood of its abandonment, the abandonment of @angular/core would be highly impactful to the project. It would essentially render the project non-functional without a complete rewrite using a different framework.",
    "impactful": true
  },
  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @taiga-ui/stylelint-config dependency is used for linting CSS and LESS files within the project. While linting is important for maintaining code quality and consistency, the functionality provided by this specific dependency is not critical to the core functionality of the Taiga UI project. It is more of a development tool that aids in maintaining code standards rather than a feature that directly impacts the end-user experience or the core library functionality.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @taiga-ui/stylelint-config appears to be minimal, as it is only referenced in the package.json file for stylelint configuration and in a list of ignorable packages. There is no evidence of deep integration within the project's codebase, such as custom rules or extensive configuration that would make replacement difficult. This suggests that the dependency is not deeply embedded in the project's codebase.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative stylelint configurations and plugins available in the npm ecosystem that could serve as suitable replacements for @taiga-ui/stylelint-config. These alternatives can provide similar or even enhanced linting capabilities. Given the availability of these alternatives, replacing @taiga-ui/stylelint-config would not be particularly difficult.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. Stylelint configurations are generally stable and do not frequently undergo breaking changes that would necessitate immediate action. Additionally, the project's use of @taiga-ui/stylelint-config does not appear to be tied to any external services or APIs that could change in a way that would impact the project.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, the abandonment of @taiga-ui/stylelint-config would not likely be directly impactful to the Taiga UI project. The dependency's role is more supportive in nature, aiding in code quality maintenance rather than being a core feature of the project. Its minimal integration and the availability of suitable alternatives further reduce the potential impact of its abandonment.",
    "impactful": false

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @angular/animations package is used in multiple components and utilities within the Taiga UI project, including animations for the sidebar, documentation components, and drawer components. These animations are crucial for providing a smooth and interactive user experience. Given the project's emphasis on a well-engineered and customizable UI, the functionality provided by @angular/animations is highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @angular/animations package is deeply integrated into the project, with direct imports in several key components and utilities. It is used for defining and controlling animations, which are fundamental to the UI's behavior and appearance. Replacing this dependency would require significant refactoring of the animation logic across multiple components.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternative animation libraries available for Angular, such as GSAP or Anime.js, these alternatives may not provide the same level of integration with Angular's change detection and component lifecycle. Additionally, switching to an alternative would require a thorough evaluation to ensure compatibility with the project's existing animation patterns and requirements.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given that @angular/animations is a core part of the Angular framework, maintained by the Angular team, the likelihood of it being abandoned is low. However, if Angular were to deprecate or significantly change its animation module, it could force the project to act. This scenario is considered unlikely but not impossible.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @angular/animations to the project's UI, the depth of its integration, and the challenges associated with finding and integrating a suitable alternative, the abandonment of this dependency would be highly impactful. However, the likelihood of such an event is low, given its status as a core Angular module.",
