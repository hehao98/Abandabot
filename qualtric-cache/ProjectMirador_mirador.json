    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Lodash is used extensively throughout the Mirador project for various utility functions such as flattening arrays, omitting properties from objects, and updating nested objects. These functionalities are crucial for the project's operation, especially in state management, plugin validation, and UI rendering. Given its widespread use and the critical nature of the functions it provides, lodash is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Lodash is deeply integrated into the Mirador project, with its functions being used in multiple components, reducers, selectors, and utility files. The project relies on lodash for essential operations like data manipulation and state management. Replacing lodash would require significant refactoring across the codebase, indicating a high level of integration difficulty.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to lodash, such as Ramda or native JavaScript functions, transitioning to these alternatives would require careful consideration and testing to ensure compatibility and performance. The availability of alternatives does not significantly reduce the difficulty of replacement due to the extensive use and specific functionalities provided by lodash in the project.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on lodash's abandonment is moderate. While lodash is a widely used library with a large community, the JavaScript ecosystem is rapidly evolving, and there could be shifts in best practices or the emergence of more efficient libraries that could influence the project's dependency choices.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the extensive use of lodash in the Mirador project for critical functionalities, its abandonment would likely be directly impactful. The project would face significant challenges in replacing lodash due to its deep integration and the lack of direct alternatives that offer the same level of utility and performance. Therefore, the abandonment of lodash would be impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @hello-pangea/dnd dependency is used for drag and drop functionality in the CanvasLayers component of the Mirador project. Given that Mirador is a multi-up viewer that supports displaying and comparing images with annotations, the ability to reorder layers via drag and drop is a significant feature for user interaction and customization. However, the project's README and the provided code snippet do not indicate that this functionality is central to the core viewing experience, suggesting that while important, it may not be critical.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @hello-pangea/dnd in the Mirador project appears to be limited to the CanvasLayers component, as indicated by the dependency usage overview. The provided code snippet shows that it is used within a specific context for drag and drop operations. This suggests a moderate level of integration, as it is not deeply woven into the core functionality of the project but is used in a specific, user-facing feature.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative libraries available for implementing drag and drop functionality in React applications, such as react-dnd and react-sortable-hoc. These libraries offer similar capabilities and could potentially serve as suitable replacements for @hello-pangea/dnd. The availability of these alternatives suggests that replacing @hello-pangea/dnd, if necessary, would be feasible, though it would require some effort to adapt the existing implementation.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is considered low. The @hello-pangea/dnd library is actively maintained and widely used in the React ecosystem. Additionally, the specific use case in the Mirador project does not appear to be highly susceptible to changes in external environments that would necessitate immediate action.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance, integration, alternatives, and likelihood scores, the abandonment of the @hello-pangea/dnd dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the Mirador project. While the drag and drop functionality is a valuable feature for user interaction, it is not central to the core viewing experience, and there are viable alternatives available. Therefore, the impact of its abandonment would be minimal.",

      "reasoning": "ESLint is used extensively throughout the project for linting JavaScript code, ensuring code quality and consistency. The project's package.json includes ESLint as a devDependency, and it is used in the 'lint' script, which is a standard part of the development workflow. Given its role in maintaining code quality, ESLint is highly important to the project.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "ESLint is integrated into the project's development workflow through the 'lint' script in package.json. It is used across various files in the project, as indicated by the dependency usage overview. However, ESLint is primarily a development tool and does not deeply integrate into the core functionality of the application. Its integration is significant but not critical to the application's runtime behavior.",

    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to ESLint for JavaScript linting, such as JSHint, Prettier (for formatting), and TSLint (for TypeScript). These tools offer similar functionality and could potentially replace ESLint. However, transitioning to an alternative would require updating the project's configuration and possibly modifying some code to comply with the new tool's rules. The availability of alternatives makes replacement feasible but not trivial.",

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on ESLint's abandonment is low. ESLint is a widely used and actively maintained tool with a large community. While any software can be abandoned, the risk is mitigated by the tool's popularity and the availability of alternatives. The project could continue using ESLint even if it were no longer actively maintained, as long as it meets the project's needs.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of ESLint in maintaining code quality, its integration into the development workflow, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of ESLint would not likely be directly impactful to the project.
