      "reasoning": "The @types/google.maps package provides TypeScript definitions for the Google Maps JavaScript API, which is crucial for TypeScript users of the @googlemaps/js-api-loader project. Given that the project itself is a TypeScript-based loader for the Google Maps JavaScript API, the absence of these type definitions would significantly hinder development, especially in terms of type safety and developer experience. Therefore, the functionality provided by @types/google.maps is highly important to the project.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/google.maps package is integrated into the project as a development dependency, specifically for TypeScript support. While it is not directly used in the runtime code, its presence is essential during the development phase for type checking and autocompletion. The integration depth is moderate because it affects the development environment rather than the runtime behavior of the application.",

    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are no direct alternatives to @types/google.maps that provide the same level of TypeScript support for the Google Maps JavaScript API. While it might be possible to manually define types or use a different mapping approach, these alternatives would require significant effort and would not offer the same convenience and reliability. Therefore, replacing @types/google.maps is considered difficult due to the lack of suitable alternatives.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The @types/google.maps package is closely tied to the Google Maps JavaScript API, which is a widely used and supported service. As long as the Google Maps JavaScript API remains available and supported, the need to replace @types/google.maps due to external changes is minimal.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @types/google.maps to the project's development environment, the difficulty of finding suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @types/google.maps would be impactful to the project. However, the impact is primarily on the development experience rather than the runtime functionality of the application.",

      "reasoning": "The geckodriver dependency is used for testing purposes in the project, specifically for end-to-end (e2e) testing with WebdriverIO. While testing is crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of the project, the core functionality of the Google Maps JavaScript API Loader does not directly depend on geckodriver. Therefore, its importance to the project's main functionality is relatively low.",

      "reasoning": "Geckodriver is integrated into the project's testing suite, as indicated by its presence in the package.json file under devDependencies. However, it is not deeply integrated into the core codebase of the project. Its usage is limited to testing scenarios, and replacing it would primarily affect the testing setup rather than the main application logic.",

      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to geckodriver for browser automation and testing, such as chromedriver for Chrome, edgedriver for Microsoft Edge, and safaridriver for Safari. These alternatives can serve similar purposes in testing environments. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace geckodriver if necessary.",

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on geckodriver's abandonment is low. Geckodriver is maintained by the Mozilla community, and while any software can be abandoned, the presence of alternatives and the specific use case of geckodriver (testing) reduce the risk of it becoming a critical issue for the project.",

However, it plays a crucial role in ensuring that the project's build process is smooth and that the code is compatible with older environments. Therefore, while not directly critical to the project's main functionality, it is important for the development and build process.",
