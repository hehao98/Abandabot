      "reasoning": "The @angular/common package is a core part of the Angular framework, providing essential functionality such as directives, pipes, and services that are widely used across the project. The project's package.json and dependency usage overview show that @angular/common is imported in multiple modules and components, indicating its critical role in the project's architecture.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "@angular/common is deeply integrated into the project, as evidenced by its widespread usage across various modules and components. The dependency usage overview shows that it is imported in over 20 different files, including core modules like is-core-ui and is-cdk, as well as specific components like is-select and is-timepicker. This deep integration makes it difficult to replace without significant refactoring.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are other frameworks and libraries that provide similar functionality to Angular, replacing @angular/common would likely require a complete migration away from Angular itself. This is a significant undertaking, as Angular's ecosystem and conventions are deeply embedded in the project. There are no direct drop-in replacements for @angular/common that would not necessitate a broader architectural shift.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given that @angular/common is a core part of the Angular framework, maintained by Google, the likelihood of it being abandoned is extremely low. Angular is a widely used and actively developed framework, and its core packages are unlikely to be abandoned in the foreseeable future.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the critical role of @angular/common in the project, its deep integration, the lack of viable alternatives, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of @angular/common would be highly impactful to the project. However, given the active maintenance and widespread use of Angular, this scenario is highly unlikely.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Protractor is used for end-to-end testing in the project, which is crucial for ensuring the application behaves as expected in a real browser environment. The project's package.json includes Protractor as a devDependency, and it is used in the e2e tests, indicating its role in the development and testing process. However, the project's README does not explicitly mention Protractor, suggesting that while important, it may not be central to the core functionality of the project.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Protractor is integrated into the project's end-to-end testing setup, as seen in the e2e/src/app.po.ts and e2e/protractor.conf.js files. The integration is specific to the testing environment and does not deeply intertwine with the core application code. This makes it relatively easier to replace compared to dependencies that are deeply embedded in the application's core logic.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Protractor for end-to-end testing in Angular applications, such as Cypress and TestCafe. These alternatives offer similar functionalities and are actively maintained, making them suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacing Protractor.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Protractor's abandonment is moderate. While Protractor is a popular tool for Angular applications, the Angular team has shifted focus towards recommending other tools like Cypress for end-to-end testing. This shift could increase the likelihood of Protractor becoming less maintained or abandoned in the future.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of Protractor for end-to-end testing, its moderate level of integration, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of Protractor would have a moderate impact on the project. It would require effort to replace, but the impact is mitigated by the existence of alternatives and the specific context of its usage in the project.",

      "reasoning": "The ngx-mask dependency is used in the is-datepicker and is-timepicker components, which are part of the IntelStudios NGX Components library. It provides functionality for input masking, which is crucial for ensuring that date and time inputs are formatted correctly. Given that date and time pickers are fundamental components in many applications, the functionality provided by ngx-mask is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "ngx-mask is integrated into the project through the use of the NgxMaskDirective and provideNgxMask function in the module files of is-datepicker and is-timepicker. This indicates a moderate level of integration, as it is used in specific components rather than being deeply embedded throughout the entire codebase. However, replacing it would still require changes in multiple files and potentially affect the functionality of the date and time pickers.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available for input masking in Angular applications, such as ng2-mask and angular2-text-mask. These alternatives provide similar functionality and could potentially serve as suitable replacements for ngx-mask. However, the ease of replacement would depend on the specific features and API differences of these alternatives.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is relatively low. ngx-mask is a widely used library with a stable API, and there is no immediate indication that it will be abandoned. However, the risk cannot be entirely ruled out, as the open-source landscape is subject to change.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the functionality provided by ngx-mask, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternative packages, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes, the abandonment of ngx-mask would likely be impactful to the project. However, the impact could be mitigated by the availability of alternative packages and the specific use of ngx-mask in the project.",
