    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @rollup/plugin-node-resolve plugin is crucial for resolving third-party modules in the project, which is essential for the build process. Without it, the project would not be able to locate and bundle necessary modules from node_modules, leading to build failures.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The plugin is integrated into the rollup.config.js file, which is central to the project's build process. It is used with specific options that tailor its behavior to the project's needs, indicating a deep integration. Replacing it would require significant changes to the build configuration.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative packages that can resolve Node modules, such as webpack's resolve plugin or other Rollup plugins. However, finding one that matches the exact configuration and behavior of @rollup/plugin-node-resolve, especially with the specific options used in this project, could be challenging.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The plugin is widely used and maintained by the Rollup team, and there is a strong community around Rollup. However, if the plugin were to be abandoned, it could eventually lead to compatibility issues with newer versions of Node.js or Rollup.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the importance of @rollup/plugin-node-resolve in the project's build process, its deep integration, and the potential challenges in finding a suitable replacement, the abandonment of this dependency would likely be impactful to the project. However, the current low likelihood of abandonment and the availability of alternatives mitigate the potential impact.",

  },
  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The rollup-plugin-sourcemaps is used in the build process of the project to handle source maps, which are crucial for debugging and development. However, its functionality is not directly tied to the core features of the glTF Sample Viewer, such as rendering or model interaction. Therefore, while important for development, it is not critical to the end-user experience or the primary functionality of the application.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of rollup-plugin-sourcemaps is limited to the build configuration file (rollup.config.js). It is used as one of several plugins in the build process, indicating a moderate level of integration. Replacing it would require changes to the build configuration but would not necessitate extensive modifications to the project's core codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to rollup-plugin-sourcemaps, such as using the inputSourceMap option in rollup-plugin-babel or other source map handling plugins. These alternatives can provide similar functionality, making it relatively easy to replace rollup-plugin-sourcemaps if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The project's build process is relatively stable, and changes in the JavaScript ecosystem that would necessitate a replacement of rollup-plugin-sourcemaps are not highly probable in the near future.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of rollup-plugin-sourcemaps to the project's build process, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could continue to function and be developed effectively even if rollup-plugin-sourcemaps were abandoned, especially given the availability of alternative solutions.",
    "impactful": false
  },
  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @rollup/plugin-commonjs is used to convert CommonJS modules to ES6 modules, which is essential for the project's build process. Given that the project relies on Rollup for bundling, and considering the presence of CommonJS modules in the dependencies, this plugin plays a crucial role in ensuring compatibility and smooth bundling.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The plugin is integrated into the project's build process as indicated in the rollup.config.js file. It is used alongside other Rollup plugins, suggesting a moderate level of integration. However, its role is specific to handling CommonJS modules, and it does not appear to be deeply intertwined with the core functionality of the project beyond the build process.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative plugins and tools available for converting CommonJS modules to ES6, such as Babel and Webpack with appropriate loaders. However, the choice of @rollup/plugin-commonjs is likely due to its compatibility with Rollup, which is the bundler used in this project. While alternatives exist, finding one that seamlessly integrates with the existing Rollup setup might require some effort.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The plugin is well-maintained and widely used within the Rollup ecosystem. However, changes in the JavaScript ecosystem, such as a shift away from CommonJS modules, could potentially impact the necessity of this plugin.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @rollup/plugin-commonjs in the project's build process, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would likely be impactful but not critically so. The project could potentially find and integrate an alternative, though it would require some effort.",
