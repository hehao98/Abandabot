    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Webpack is a critical tool for bundling JavaScript files and other assets in modern web development. In the context of the InseeFrLab/onyxia-ui project, it is used in the Storybook configuration for building the UI components. Given that Storybook is a key tool for developing and showcasing UI components, the functionality provided by webpack is essential for the project's development workflow.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Webpack is integrated into the project through the Storybook configuration, specifically in the .storybook/main.js file where it is set as the builder. This indicates a moderate level of integration, as it is not directly used in the main application code but is crucial for the development and testing environment.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to webpack, such as Parcel, Rollup, and Vite, which also offer module bundling capabilities. However, webpack's extensive plugin ecosystem and widespread adoption make it a preferred choice for many projects. The availability of alternatives suggests that replacing webpack is feasible, but it may require significant effort to migrate the build configuration and ensure compatibility with existing plugins and tools.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on webpack's abandonment is relatively low. Webpack is a mature and widely used tool with a large community and ongoing development. However, the JavaScript ecosystem is fast-moving, and shifts in tooling preferences or the emergence of more efficient bundlers could potentially impact webpack's dominance.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of webpack in the project's development workflow, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of webpack would be impactful but not critically so. The project could transition to an alternative bundler with some effort, but the immediate impact on the development process would be significant.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @storybook/preset-create-react-app is used in the project for setting up Storybook with Create React App. While it is useful for development and testing, it is not directly involved in the core functionality of the Onyxia UI toolkit, which is a React UI toolkit implementing a design system. The core functionality of the project, such as providing custom components and styling, does not depend on this package. Therefore, its importance to the project is relatively low.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @storybook/preset-create-react-app in the project is minimal. It is only mentioned in the .storybook/main.js file as part of the addons configuration for Storybook. This indicates that it is used for setting up Storybook but is not deeply integrated into the project's codebase. Replacing it would not require significant changes to the project's core code.",

    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @storybook/preset-create-react-app for setting up Storybook with different configurations or frameworks. These alternatives can provide similar functionality for Storybook setup. Given the availability of these alternatives, replacing @storybook/preset-create-react-app would not be difficult.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The package is used for development and testing purposes, and its abandonment would not directly impact the production build or the core functionality of the Onyxia UI toolkit. The project could continue to use the package as long as it remains functional, or switch to an alternative without significant impact.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the low importance, minimal integration, availability of alternatives, and low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of @storybook/preset-create-react-app would not likely be directly impactful to the Onyxia UI project. The package is used for development and testing purposes and does not play a critical role in the project's core functionality.",

      "reasoning": "The @emotion/styled package is used for styling components in the project. Given that the project is a React UI toolkit, styling is a fundamental aspect of its functionality. The project's README mentions that it is built on top of MUI and uses tss-react for styling, indicating that @emotion/styled plays a crucial role in the project's styling solution. Therefore, the functionality provided by @emotion/styled is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The project's package.json lists @emotion/styled as a devDependency, which suggests it is used during development but not directly in the production build. However, given the nature of the project as a UI toolkit, it is likely that @emotion/styled is deeply integrated into the project's component styling system. Replacing it would require significant changes to the project's styling approach, especially considering its integration with MUI and tss-react.",

      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @emotion/styled for styling React components, such as styled-components, JSS, and CSS modules. However, the project's integration with MUI and tss-react might limit the suitability of some alternatives. While alternatives exist, finding one that seamlessly integrates with the project's current setup and provides the same level of functionality and performance could be challenging.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While @emotion/styled is a popular library, the React ecosystem is dynamic, and changes in the ecosystem or the emergence of new styling solutions could impact the project's dependency choices. However, given the project's current setup and the stability of the @emotion/styled library, such changes are not imminent.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @emotion/styled to the project's styling solution, the depth of its integration, the availability of alternatives, and the likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of @emotion/styled would be impactful to the project. However, the impact is mitigated by the existence of alternatives and the project's ability to adapt to changes in the ecosystem.",
