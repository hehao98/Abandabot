    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Lerna is used for managing multiple packages within the Vivliostyle project, which is crucial for the development and maintenance of the project. It handles tasks like building, testing, and versioning across packages. Given its role in the project's build and development process, its functionality is highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Lerna is integrated into the project's scripts for building, testing, and versioning. It is used in various scripts within the package.json file, indicating a deep integration into the project's development workflow. Replacing it would require significant changes to these scripts and potentially the project's structure.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternatives to Lerna, such as Nx and Rush, which offer similar functionality for managing monorepos. However, transitioning to an alternative would require evaluating the new tool's compatibility with the project's current setup and potentially refactoring parts of the project.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Lerna's abandonment is moderate. While Lerna is a key tool for the project, the JavaScript ecosystem is dynamic, and alternatives exist. However, the project's current deep integration with Lerna means that any change would require careful consideration and planning.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given Lerna's importance in managing the project's monorepo structure and its deep integration into the development workflow, its abandonment would likely be impactful. However, the existence of alternatives and the dynamic nature of the JavaScript ecosystem mitigate this impact to some extent.",

      "reasoning": "Prettier is used in the project for code formatting, which is a common practice in JavaScript projects to maintain code consistency. However, the functionality provided by Prettier is not directly related to the core functionality of Vivliostyle.js, which is HTML+CSS typesetting and rich paged viewing with EPUB/Web publications support. Therefore, while Prettier is useful for maintaining code quality, its functionality is not critical to the project's main features.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Prettier is integrated into the project's development workflow through ESLint configurations in the `eslint.config.mjs` files of the `core` and `viewer` packages. It is used as a plugin in ESLint to enforce code formatting rules. The integration is not deeply embedded into the core functionality of the project but is rather a part of the development toolchain. Replacing Prettier would require updating the ESLint configurations but would not significantly impact the project's core functionality.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Prettier for code formatting in JavaScript projects, such as ESLint's built-in formatting rules, StandardJS, and Beautify. These alternatives can provide similar functionality and could be used as replacements if Prettier were to be abandoned. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace Prettier in the project.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Prettier's abandonment is low. Prettier is widely used and supported in the JavaScript community, and there is no immediate indication that it will be abandoned. Even if Prettier were to be abandoned, the project could continue using it as long as it meets the project's needs, or it could switch to an alternative code formatting tool without significant impact.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, Prettier's abandonment would not likely be directly impactful to the Vivliostyle.js project. Its functionality, while useful for maintaining code quality, is not critical to the project's core features. The integration of Prettier is not deeply embedded into the project, and there are several alternatives available that could serve as suitable replacements. Additionally, the likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Prettier's abandonment is low.",

      "reasoning": "The dependency shelljs is used in the project for file and directory manipulation tasks such as creating directories, copying files, and removing files. These tasks are essential for the build and deployment process of the project. However, the functionality provided by shelljs is not core to the main functionality of Vivliostyle.js, which is HTML+CSS typesetting and rich paged viewing. Therefore, while important, it is not critical to the primary purpose of the project.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "shelljs is integrated into the project through the `scripts/create-archive.js` file, where it is used for various file and directory operations. The integration is limited to this script and does not deeply permeate the core functionality of the project. Replacing shelljs would require rewriting the file and directory manipulation logic in this script, but it would not affect the core functionality of Vivliostyle.js.",

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on shelljs's abandonment is low. shelljs is a stable and widely used package, and there are no immediate signs of it becoming abandoned. Additionally, the project's reliance on shelljs is limited to a single script, reducing the impact of any potential abandonment.",
      "score": 1

    "reasoning": "Considering the importance, integration, availability of alternatives, and likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of shelljs would not likely be directly impactful to the Vivliostyle.js project. The functionality provided by shelljs is important but not critical to the core functionality of the project, and there are suitable alternatives available. The limited integration of shelljs into the project further reduces the potential impact of its abandonment.",
