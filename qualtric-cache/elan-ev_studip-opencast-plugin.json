    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The vue-axios package is used to integrate axios with Vue.js, which is a crucial part of handling HTTP requests in the project. Given that the project is a plugin for connecting Opencast with Stud.IP, handling HTTP requests efficiently is essential for its core functionality. The dependency is directly used in the main application setup, indicating its importance in the project's architecture.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "vue-axios is integrated into the project at a foundational level, as seen in the app.js file where it is used to bind axios to the Vue instance. This suggests a deep integration, as changing this dependency would require modifications to how HTTP requests are handled throughout the application. The integration is straightforward but central to the application's functionality.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to vue-axios for integrating axios with Vue.js, such as directly using axios without a wrapper or using other HTTP client libraries that are compatible with Vue.js. However, replacing vue-axios would require refactoring the code to adapt to the new library's API, which could be time-consuming but not technically complex.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While vue-axios is a popular package, the Vue.js ecosystem is dynamic, and changes in Vue.js or axios could impact the compatibility or necessity of vue-axios. However, such changes are not imminent or highly likely in the short term.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of vue-axios in handling HTTP requests within the project, its deep integration, the availability of alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of vue-axios would be impactful but manageable. The project would need to invest time in refactoring the code to replace vue-axios, but it is not a critical dependency that would halt the project's functionality.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The file-loader is used in the project to handle file imports and emit them into the output directory. Given the project's nature as a plugin for Stud.IP and Opencast, which involves handling various assets like images, the functionality provided by file-loader is crucial for managing these assets efficiently. However, the project's core functionality does not solely rely on file-loader, as it is more about integrating Opencast with Stud.IP. Therefore, while important, it is not the most critical dependency.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The file-loader is integrated into the project's webpack configuration, which is a common setup for handling static assets in web applications. The integration is straightforward and does not involve complex customizations or deep integration into the project's core logic. Replacing file-loader would require adjustments to the webpack configuration but would not necessitate extensive changes to the project's codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to file-loader, such as url-loader, which can handle similar tasks of loading files and emitting them into the output directory. These alternatives are well-maintained and widely used in the webpack ecosystem, making them suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacing file-loader.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The webpack ecosystem is stable, and file-loader is a widely used package with a large community. While abandonment is always a possibility, the current state of the ecosystem and the package's popularity suggest that such an event is unlikely in the near future.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of file-loader to the project's asset management, the ease of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of forced action due to external changes, the abandonment of file-loader would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could transition to an alternative with minimal disruption.",

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The regenerator-runtime is a crucial dependency for projects that use async functions and generators, especially when targeting older browsers that do not natively support these features. Given that the project is a plugin for an LMS (Learning Management System) and likely needs to support a wide range of environments, the functionality provided by regenerator-runtime is important for ensuring compatibility and smooth operation across different browsers and versions.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of regenerator-runtime in the project appears to be minimal, as it is listed as a devDependency in the package.json file. This suggests that it is used during the build process rather than being deeply integrated into the project's runtime code. Therefore, replacing it would not require extensive changes to the project's codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to regenerator-runtime that can provide similar functionality, such as Babel's polyfill or core-js. These alternatives are widely used and maintained, making them suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacing regenerator-runtime.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The project's compatibility with a wide range of browsers and environments is important, but the use of regenerator-runtime as a devDependency suggests that its abandonment would not immediately impact the project's runtime environment. Additionally, the availability of alternatives further reduces the likelihood of being forced to act.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of regenerator-runtime for ensuring compatibility across different environments, its minimal integration in the project, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of being forced to act due to external changes, the abandonment of regenerator-runtime would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project can continue to function without immediate issues, and there are viable paths for replacement if necessary.",
