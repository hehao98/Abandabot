    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Axios is used extensively throughout the project for making HTTP requests, including fetching data from the Google Books API, saving books to the database, and deleting saved books. It is a core dependency for the project's functionality, enabling communication between the client and server, and between the server and external APIs.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Axios is deeply integrated into the project, with its usage spread across multiple files including client-side utilities, server-side routes, and React components. It is used for both GET and POST requests, indicating a significant level of integration within the project's codebase.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to Axios such as the Fetch API or other HTTP request libraries like SuperAgent, Axios provides a more convenient and feature-rich API for handling HTTP requests, including request and response interception, automatic JSON data transformation, and client-side support for protecting against XSRF. Replacing Axios would require significant refactoring and might not offer the same level of functionality and ease of use.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given Axios's popularity, active maintenance, and widespread use in the JavaScript ecosystem, the likelihood of it being abandoned in the near future is low. However, the JavaScript ecosystem is fast-evolving, and changes in browser standards or the emergence of new libraries could potentially impact Axios's relevance.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the critical role Axios plays in the project's functionality, its deep integration across the codebase, the availability of alternatives with potential trade-offs, and the low likelihood of its abandonment, the abandonment of Axios would likely be impactful to the project. It would require significant effort to replace and could affect the project's ability to make HTTP requests efficiently.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The if-env dependency is used in the project's package.json to determine which script to run based on the environment (production or development). This functionality is crucial for the project's deployment and development workflow, as it ensures the correct scripts are executed in different environments. Without it, the project would need a more complex setup to achieve the same result, potentially leading to errors or inefficiencies.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The if-env dependency is integrated into the project's package.json scripts section, specifically in the 'start' script. This is a relatively shallow integration, as it only affects the script execution and does not deeply intertwine with the project's core codebase. Replacing or removing if-env would require modifying the 'start' script but would not necessitate extensive changes throughout the project.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative packages available that can provide similar or even enhanced functionality compared to if-env. The dependency's README itself recommends switching to 'per-env', which is described as simpler and more powerful. This indicates that finding a suitable replacement would not be difficult, and the transition could potentially improve the project's setup.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on if-env's abandonment is low. The dependency's functionality is specific to script execution based on environment variables, a niche that is unlikely to be directly impacted by broader environmental changes. However, the recommendation to switch to 'per-env' suggests that the ecosystem is evolving, which could indirectly influence the project's decision.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of if-env in the project's deployment and development workflow, its relatively shallow integration, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of if-env would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could transition to an alternative like 'per-env' with minimal effort, potentially even improving its setup in the process.",
    "impactful": false
  },
  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The `cors` package is used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in the project. Given that the project is a full MERN stack app that likely interacts with a frontend and possibly third-party APIs, CORS is essential for allowing or restricting resources requested from another domain. Without CORS, the app may face issues with cross-origin requests, which are common in web applications. Therefore, the functionality provided by `cors` is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The `cors` package is integrated into the project as a middleware in the Express server. Middleware integration is relatively straightforward and does not deeply intertwine with the core logic of the application. Replacing `cors` would require finding an alternative package that provides similar middleware functionality and updating the server configuration accordingly. This process is not overly complex but does require some effort.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available that provide similar CORS functionality, such as `express-cors` and `http-cors`. These alternatives offer comparable features and can be integrated into the project with similar ease. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace `cors` if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. CORS is a well-established standard for handling cross-origin requests, and the `cors` package is widely used and maintained. However, if the package were to become abandoned, the project might need to consider alternatives to ensure continued compatibility and security.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of CORS functionality to the project, the relatively straightforward integration of the `cors` package, the availability of alternative packages, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of `cors` would not likely be directly impactful to the project. However, it is still a critical component that ensures the app's ability to handle cross-origin requests effectively.",
