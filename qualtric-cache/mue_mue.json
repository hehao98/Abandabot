    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The react-toastify dependency is used across multiple components in the Mue project for displaying notifications and toasts. These notifications are crucial for user feedback, such as success messages, error alerts, and achievement unlocks. Given its widespread use and the importance of user feedback in enhancing user experience, the functionality provided by react-toastify is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "React-toastify is integrated into various components and features across the Mue project, including settings, marketplace, stats, and more. Its usage is not limited to a single feature but is spread across the application, indicating a deep integration. Replacing it would require updating all these components, which could be time-consuming and error-prone.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to react-toastify available in the React ecosystem, such as react-notifications, notistack, and react-snackbar. These alternatives offer similar functionalities and could potentially serve as suitable replacements. However, the ease of migration would depend on the specific features used and the compatibility with the existing codebase.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is relatively low. React-toastify is a well-maintained library with a large community and regular updates. However, unforeseen circumstances such as the maintainer stepping away or a critical security issue could necessitate action.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of react-toastify to the Mue project for user feedback, its deep integration across various components, the availability of alternative packages, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of react-toastify would likely be impactful to the project. The project would need to invest significant effort in finding and integrating a suitable replacement, which could affect development timelines and user experience.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @commitlint/config-conventional package is used to enforce conventional commit messages in the project. While this is a good practice for maintaining a clean and understandable commit history, it is not directly related to the core functionality of the Mue browser extension, which is to provide a customizable new tab page. The enforcement of commit message conventions is more about project maintenance and developer experience rather than the end-user functionality. Therefore, its importance to the project is moderate.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @commitlint/config-conventional in the project is minimal. It is only referenced in the .commitlintrc.json file to extend its configuration. There are no direct code dependencies or integrations within the project's source code. This makes it relatively easy to replace or remove without significant impact on the project's codebase.",

These alternatives provide similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements for @commitlint/config-conventional. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace the dependency if needed.",

Changes in the external environment are unlikely to directly impact the need for or the functionality provided by this package.",

    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, the abandonment of @commitlint/config-conventional would not likely be directly impactful to the Mue project. Its role in enforcing commit message conventions, while beneficial for project maintenance, is not critical to the core functionality of the browser extension. The minimal integration and availability of alternatives further reduce the potential impact of its abandonment.",

      "reasoning": "The stylelint-scss package is used for linting SCSS files in the Mue project. Given that Mue is a browser extension with a focus on a customisable tab page, the visual consistency and correctness of styles are crucial. The functionality provided by stylelint-scss ensures that SCSS code adheres to best practices, which is important for maintaining a high-quality codebase. However, the direct impact on the end-user experience is minimal, as it primarily affects development practices.",

The depth of integration is shallow, as it does not directly affect the core functionality or the build process of the project. Replacing or removing it would not require significant changes to the codebase.",
