    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency 'mapbox-gl-leaflet' is used to integrate Mapbox GL JS with Leaflet, providing advanced mapping features. Given that the Nextcloud Maps project heavily relies on mapping functionalities, the integration of Mapbox GL JS through 'mapbox-gl-leaflet' is crucial for delivering a rich user experience with features like different map styles and potentially more advanced mapping capabilities in the future. Therefore, the functionality provided by this dependency is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of 'mapbox-gl-leaflet' within the Nextcloud Maps project appears to be deep, as it is used to bridge Mapbox GL JS with Leaflet, which is a core component of the project's mapping functionality. Replacing this dependency would require significant changes to the codebase to either find a new way to integrate Mapbox GL JS or to switch to a different mapping library altogether, which could be complex and time-consuming.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternatives to 'mapbox-gl-leaflet' for integrating Mapbox GL JS with Leaflet, such as '@maplibre/maplibre-gl-leaflet', which is already listed as a dependency in the project's package.json. This suggests that the project maintainers are aware of and have access to alternative solutions. However, switching to an alternative would still require some level of codebase adjustment and testing to ensure compatibility and feature parity.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the dependency is marked as experimental and not actively supported by Mapbox, the project has already included an alternative dependency ('@maplibre/maplibre-gl-leaflet') which could mitigate the impact of 'mapbox-gl-leaflet' becoming abandoned. However, changes in Mapbox's API or licensing could still necessitate action.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of 'mapbox-gl-leaflet' to the Nextcloud Maps project, its deep integration, the availability of alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would likely be impactful. However, the presence of an alternative dependency reduces the potential impact, making it manageable with some effort.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @nextcloud/browserslist-config dependency is used to define the list of browsers that the project should support. While this is important for ensuring compatibility across different browsers, it does not directly impact the core functionality of the Nextcloud Maps app, which is centered around map rendering and interaction. Therefore, its importance to the project is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project through the package.json file, specifically in the 'browserslist' field. This is a standard and straightforward integration that does not deeply intertwine with the project's codebase. Replacing or removing this dependency would require minimal changes, primarily updating the 'browserslist' field in package.json.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives available for defining browser compatibility in a project, including directly specifying the list of browsers in the package.json file or using other shared configurations. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace @nextcloud/browserslist-config if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. Browser compatibility requirements tend to evolve slowly, and changes in this area are unlikely to necessitate immediate action. Additionally, the project could easily switch to an alternative configuration if needed.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of @nextcloud/browserslist-config to the project, its shallow integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the Nextcloud Maps project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @nextcloud/auth package provides essential authentication and user-related functionalities for the Nextcloud Maps project. Given that authentication is a core aspect of any application that requires user interaction, the functionality provided by this dependency is crucial for the project's operation. It ensures that user sessions are managed correctly and that only authorized users can access certain features. Therefore, the importance of this dependency to the project is very high.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @nextcloud/auth package is deeply integrated into the Nextcloud Maps project, as it is used for handling user authentication and session management. Replacing this dependency would require significant changes to the project's codebase, especially in parts that handle user authentication, session management, and access control. This level of integration makes it difficult to replace without extensive refactoring.",

    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternative packages available for handling authentication in JavaScript applications, finding a suitable replacement that integrates as seamlessly with Nextcloud's ecosystem as @nextcloud/auth does would be challenging. The package is specifically designed for Nextcloud applications, making it uniquely suited for this project. Alternatives would likely require additional customization and testing to ensure compatibility and security, increasing the difficulty of replacement.",

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is relatively low. @nextcloud/auth is a core library maintained by the Nextcloud team, and its abandonment would significantly impact not just this project but the entire Nextcloud ecosystem. However, in the unlikely event of its abandonment, the project would be forced to find a replacement or fork the library to maintain functionality.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the critical role of @nextcloud/auth in handling authentication and user sessions within the Nextcloud Maps project, its abandonment would have a significant impact. The dependency is deeply integrated into the project, and finding a suitable replacement would be challenging due to its specific design for Nextcloud applications. While the likelihood of abandonment is low, the potential impact is high, making it a noteworthy dependency for the project.",
