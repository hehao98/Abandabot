    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Mithril is used extensively throughout the GenieACS UI components, as evidenced by the numerous imports and usage in various UI files. It is a core library for rendering the user interface, handling components, and managing the state of the UI. Given its widespread use, the functionality provided by Mithril is crucial for the project's UI layer.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Mithril is deeply integrated into the GenieACS project, with its components and functions being used across almost all UI-related files. Replacing Mithril would require a significant refactoring effort, as it is not just a superficial dependency but a foundational part of the UI architecture.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to Mithril, such as React, Vue, or Svelte, transitioning to any of these would require a substantial amount of work. This includes not only rewriting the components but also potentially changing the state management and routing logic. The availability of alternatives does not significantly reduce the difficulty of replacement due to the depth of Mithril's integration.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Mithril's abandonment is moderate. While Mithril is a stable library, the JavaScript ecosystem evolves rapidly, and shifts in community preferences or the emergence of new, more efficient libraries could necessitate a change. However, this is not an immediate concern but something to monitor over time.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given Mithril's critical role in the GenieACS UI, its deep integration, and the significant effort required to replace it, the abandonment of Mithril would be highly impactful to the project. While there are alternatives, the transition would be complex and time-consuming. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor the health and maintenance status of Mithril closely.",

  },
  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency @types/mithril is a TypeScript definition package for Mithril, a JavaScript framework. Given that GenieACS is a high-performance Auto Configuration Server primarily focused on TR-069 device management, the direct impact of Mithril or its TypeScript definitions on the core functionality of GenieACS is minimal. The project's README and package.json do not indicate that Mithril is a critical part of the system's architecture or functionality. Therefore, the importance of @types/mithril to the project is low.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Since @types/mithril is a TypeScript definition package, its integration into the project is limited to providing type definitions for Mithril. The package.json file shows that Mithril itself is a devDependency, suggesting it is used during development rather than in the production environment. The depth of integration of @types/mithril in the project's code base is shallow, as it is not directly involved in the core functionalities of GenieACS.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative JavaScript frameworks and TypeScript definition packages available that could serve as suitable replacements for Mithril and @types/mithril, respectively. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace @types/mithril if necessary. The project's reliance on Mithril for development purposes does not lock it into using this specific framework, as other frameworks could be used for similar development tasks.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the abandonment of @types/mithril is low. Since @types/mithril is a TypeScript definition package for a development dependency, changes in the external environment are unlikely to directly impact the project's core functionalities. The project could continue to operate without immediate action, even if @types/mithril were to be abandoned.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the low importance, shallow integration, availability of alternatives, and low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of @types/mithril would not likely be directly impactful to the GenieACS project. The dependency is used for development purposes and does not play a critical role in the project's core functionalities.",

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The jsonwebtoken dependency is used for signing JWTs in the GenieACS UI, which is crucial for authentication and session management. Given that the UI is a core component of GenieACS, the functionality provided by jsonwebtoken is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of jsonwebtoken in the project is relatively straightforward, used in a single location within the UI component for signing JWTs. This suggests a shallow integration depth, making it less difficult to replace if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available for JWT handling in Node.js, such as jose, njwt, and others. These alternatives provide similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements, indicating that replacing jsonwebtoken would not be overly difficult.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. jsonwebtoken is a widely used and maintained package, and there is no immediate indication of it becoming abandoned or unsupported.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of jsonwebtoken to the project's authentication mechanism, its shallow integration depth, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of it becoming abandoned, the abandonment of jsonwebtoken would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",
