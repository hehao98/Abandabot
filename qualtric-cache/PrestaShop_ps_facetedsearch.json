    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The babel-loader is crucial for the project as it is used to transpile JavaScript files using Babel, which is essential for ensuring compatibility across different environments. Given that the project's build and development scripts rely on webpack and Babel for processing JavaScript files, the functionality provided by babel-loader is highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "babel-loader is integrated into the project's webpack configuration, specifically in the rules section where it processes JavaScript files. This integration is straightforward and limited to the webpack configuration file, making it relatively easy to replace if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to babel-loader that can be used with webpack for transpiling JavaScript, such as ts-loader for TypeScript or esbuild-loader for faster builds. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace babel-loader, provided the project's requirements can be met by these alternatives.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on babel-loader's abandonment is moderate. While Babel and webpack are widely used and supported, changes in JavaScript standards or webpack's ecosystem could necessitate a switch. However, such changes are not imminent or highly likely in the short term.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of babel-loader in the project's build process, its relatively easy integration, the availability of alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of external changes necessitating action, the abandonment of babel-loader would be impactful but not critically so. The project could transition to an alternative with some effort, but the functionality provided by babel-loader is essential for the current build process.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The eslint-config-prestashop dependency is used for linting JavaScript code, ensuring code quality and consistency across the project. While important for maintaining code standards, it does not directly affect the core functionality of the faceted search module. Therefore, its importance is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project through the .eslintrc configuration file and is used in the npm scripts for linting. However, it is not deeply embedded in the core logic of the application, making it relatively easy to replace or remove.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative ESLint configurations available, such as eslint-config-airbnb, eslint-config-google, and eslint-config-standard. These alternatives could serve as suitable replacements, providing similar functionality for code linting.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. ESLint configurations are generally stable, and changes in the ecosystem are unlikely to necessitate immediate action.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the moderate importance of the eslint-config-prestashop dependency for code quality, its relatively shallow integration into the project, the availability of alternative configurations, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to ESLint for JavaScript linting, such as JSHint, Prettier (for formatting), and TSLint (for TypeScript). These alternatives could potentially serve as suitable replacements, providing similar functionality. The availability of these alternatives makes replacing ESLint less difficult.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on ESLint's abandonment is low. ESLint is widely used and supported, and its abandonment would likely be gradual, giving the project time to adapt. Additionally, the project could switch to an alternative linter without significant disruption.",
