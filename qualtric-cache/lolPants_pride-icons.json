    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @radix-ui/react-avatar dependency is used to create avatar components in the project, which are essential for displaying user avatars with pride flag borders. Given the project's focus on enhancing social media avatars with pride flags, the functionality provided by this dependency is crucial for the core feature of the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is deeply integrated into the project's codebase, as evidenced by its usage in the avatar.tsx file to create avatar components. The project relies on this dependency for rendering avatars, indicating a high level of integration.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternative packages available for creating avatar components in React, finding one that offers the same level of customization and ease of use as @radix-ui/react-avatar might be challenging. However, the availability of alternatives suggests that replacing the dependency, though potentially time-consuming, is feasible.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. Changes in React or other dependencies could necessitate updates or replacements, but such changes are not imminent or guaranteed.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the importance of the @radix-ui/react-avatar dependency to the project's core functionality and its deep integration into the codebase, its abandonment would likely be impactful. However, the availability of alternatives and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action suggest that while the impact would be significant, it is manageable.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @radix-ui/react-label dependency is used to create labels in the UI components of the project. Given the project's focus on enhancing social media avatars with pride flag borders, labels might be used for accessibility or to provide context to UI elements. However, the core functionality of the project does not heavily rely on labels, making the dependency's importance moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project through a single component (components/ui/label.tsx). The integration is straightforward, with the dependency being used to extend a label component. This indicates a shallow level of integration, making it relatively easy to replace or remove the dependency without significant refactoring.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives available for creating labels in React applications, such as native HTML label elements or other UI libraries that provide label components. The availability of these alternatives makes it easier to replace @radix-ui/react-label if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The project's core functionality does not depend on the label component, and there are no indications that the project would be significantly affected by changes in the dependency's status.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of the @radix-ui/react-label dependency to the project, its shallow integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/node package provides TypeScript definitions for Node.js, which are essential for TypeScript projects that interact with Node.js APIs. However, the project 'pride-avatars' is a Next.js application, and while it does use Node.js under the hood, the direct interaction with Node.js APIs is minimal. The primary functionality of the project revolves around enhancing social media avatars with pride flag borders, which does not heavily rely on Node.js specific features. Therefore, the importance of @types/node to the project is moderate.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/node package is a devDependency, indicating it is used during development rather than in the production build. Its integration into the project is limited to providing TypeScript definitions for Node.js APIs. Given that the project is a Next.js application, the direct usage of Node.js APIs is minimal, and the integration of @types/node is not deeply embedded in the project's codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are no direct alternatives to @types/node for providing TypeScript definitions for Node.js APIs. However, if the project were to stop using TypeScript or switch to a different runtime environment that does not require Node.js, the need for @types/node could be eliminated. Given the lack of direct alternatives but the possibility of architectural changes to reduce dependency, the difficulty of replacing @types/node is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the abandonment of @types/node is low. Node.js is a stable and widely used runtime environment, and its TypeScript definitions are maintained by the community. While it is possible for the package to become abandoned, the impact on the project would be minimal due to the project's limited direct interaction with Node.js APIs.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of @types/node to the project, its limited integration, the moderate difficulty of finding alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @types/node would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could continue to function with minimal adjustments, and the need for TypeScript definitions for Node.js APIs could be mitigated through architectural changes if necessary.",
