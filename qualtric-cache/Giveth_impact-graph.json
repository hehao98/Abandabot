      "reasoning": "Axios is used extensively throughout the project for making HTTP requests, including interactions with external APIs, GraphQL queries, and handling various data operations. Its functionality is critical for the project's data fetching and communication with external services.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Axios is deeply integrated into the project, with numerous instances across different modules and services. It is used in various contexts, including data fetching, API interactions, and handling responses. Replacing it would require significant refactoring of the codebase.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Axios, such as Fetch API, node-fetch, and got. However, Axios's feature set, including request/response interception, automatic JSON data transformation, and wide browser support, makes it a preferred choice. While alternatives exist, they may not offer the same level of convenience and functionality.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of Axios being abandoned is low, given its widespread use, active maintenance, and community support. However, any significant changes in the JavaScript ecosystem or the emergence of a more efficient library could potentially impact its usage.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role of Axios in the project for handling HTTP requests and its deep integration across various modules, its abandonment would have a significant impact. However, the likelihood of such an event is low due to Axios's active maintenance and community support. Therefore, while the impact would be high, the likelihood is low, making the overall impact moderate.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/mocha package provides TypeScript definitions for the Mocha testing framework. While it is essential for TypeScript projects that use Mocha for testing, its importance is limited to the development and testing phases. It does not directly impact the production functionality of the project.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/mocha package is used in the development environment for type checking and autocompletion. It is not deeply integrated into the project's core codebase but is rather a tool that aids in development. Replacing it would not require significant changes to the project's code.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative TypeScript definition packages available for Mocha, such as DefinitelyTyped, which could serve as suitable replacements. Additionally, the project could switch to using JavaScript for testing, eliminating the need for TypeScript definitions altogether.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the abandonment of @types/mocha is low. The package is not a critical dependency, and there are viable alternatives available. The project could continue to function without immediate action.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Given that @types/mocha is primarily a development dependency with limited impact on the production environment, and considering the availability of alternatives and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",
    "impactful": false

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Lodash is used in multiple parts of the project, including utility functions like `_.uniq` for unique array elements and `_.groupBy` for grouping data. These functions are essential for data manipulation and processing within the project, indicating a high level of importance.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Lodash is integrated into several key components of the project, such as data aggregation and cron job services. Its functions are deeply embedded in the logic for handling data, suggesting a high level of integration.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to Lodash, such as native JavaScript methods or other utility libraries, replacing Lodash would require significant refactoring due to its widespread use and specific functionalities within the project.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given Lodash's widespread use and active maintenance, the likelihood of its abandonment is low. However, external environmental changes, such as major shifts in JavaScript standards or community preferences, could potentially impact its relevance.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance and integration of Lodash in the project, its abandonment would likely be impactful. However, the low likelihood of abandonment and the availability of alternatives mitigate this impact to some extent.",
