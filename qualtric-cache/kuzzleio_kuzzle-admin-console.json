      "reasoning": "Lodash is used extensively throughout the project for various utility functions such as object manipulation, array handling, and data formatting. It is imported in multiple components and services, indicating its critical role in the project's functionality. The dependency is used for essential operations like data handling, validation, and state management, which are crucial for the admin console's operation.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Lodash is deeply integrated into the project, with its methods being used in numerous components and services. The project relies on specific Lodash functions for critical operations, and replacing these would require significant refactoring of the codebase. The dependency is not just used in isolated parts of the project but is woven into the core functionality, making its replacement challenging.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to Lodash, such as native JavaScript methods or other utility libraries, finding a suitable replacement that offers the same level of functionality and ease of use could be difficult. The project's reliance on specific Lodash methods means that any alternative would need to provide equivalent functionality without introducing new issues or requiring extensive code changes.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Lodash's abandonment is moderate. While Lodash is a widely used library with a large community, changes in the JavaScript ecosystem or the emergence of new standards could potentially reduce its relevance. However, given its current widespread use and the lack of immediate alternatives that offer the same level of utility, the likelihood of such changes forcing action is not high.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the extensive use of Lodash in the project, its deep integration into the codebase, and the challenges associated with finding a suitable replacement, the abandonment of Lodash would likely be directly impactful to the project. The dependency plays a critical role in the project's functionality, and its loss would require significant effort to mitigate.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The vue-multipane dependency is used in the Layout.vue component of the Kuzzle Admin Console, which suggests it plays a role in the UI layout management. However, the project's README and the provided code snippets do not indicate that vue-multipane is central to the core functionality of the Kuzzle Admin Console, which is to manage Kuzzle instances. The functionality provided by vue-multipane, while useful, does not seem to be critical to the primary operations of the admin console.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of vue-multipane in the project appears to be limited to a single component (Layout.vue). There is no evidence of widespread usage across the project's codebase. This suggests that replacing vue-multipane would not require extensive changes to the project's code, as its usage is confined to a specific area.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available for Vue.js that provide similar resizable split pane functionality, such as vue-splitpane and vue-resizable. These alternatives could serve as suitable replacements for vue-multipane, offering similar features and integration capabilities. The availability of these alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacing vue-multipane.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the nature of vue-multipane as a UI utility library and the availability of alternative packages, it is unlikely that external environmental changes would force the project to act on the dependency's abandonment. The project could continue to use the current version of vue-multipane or switch to an alternative without significant impact.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the limited importance of vue-multipane to the core functionality of the Kuzzle Admin Console, its minimal integration in the project's codebase, the availability of alternative packages, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of vue-multipane would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @vue/test-utils dependency is used for testing Vue components in the project. While testing is crucial for maintaining code quality and ensuring functionality, the direct impact on the core functionality of the Kuzzle Admin Console is minimal. The project can still function and be deployed without passing tests, although this is not ideal for long-term maintenance and reliability. Therefore, the importance of this dependency to the project's core functionality is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @vue/test-utils is integrated into the project as a devDependency, used primarily for testing purposes. Its integration depth is limited to the testing phase and does not affect the main application's runtime or build process. Replacing or removing this dependency would primarily impact the testing suite rather than the application's core functionality. Thus, the difficulty of replacing this dependency, considering its integration depth, is relatively low.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @vue/test-utils for testing Vue components, such as Jest with Vue Test Utils, Testing Library for Vue, and others. These alternatives provide similar functionalities for component testing. The availability of these alternatives makes it easier to replace @vue/test-utils if necessary. Therefore, the difficulty of replacing this dependency, considering the availability of alternative packages, is low.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The Vue ecosystem is stable, and @vue/test-utils is a widely used and maintained library. However, changes in Vue's core or testing paradigms could potentially impact the relevance or functionality of @vue/test-utils. Despite this, the risk is considered minimal in the short to medium term.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, the abandonment of @vue/test-utils would have a moderate impact on the project. While it is important for testing Vue components, its direct impact on the core functionality of the Kuzzle Admin Console is limited. The availability of alternatives and the relatively shallow integration depth mitigate the potential impact of its abandonment. Therefore, while noteworthy, the abandonment of this dependency would not be directly impactful to the project's core operations.",
