      "reasoning": "The styled-components library is used extensively across multiple components in the project for styling purposes. It provides a way to write CSS in JavaScript, which is crucial for the project's component-based architecture. The dependency is used in key components like headers, footers, results, and facets, indicating its importance in the overall UI/UX of the application.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "styled-components is deeply integrated into the project, as evidenced by its usage in multiple components across the application. The library is used to style components dynamically based on context and props, which suggests a high level of integration. Replacing it would require significant refactoring of the component styles and possibly the architecture of how styles are managed in the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to styled-components, such as Emotion, JSS, and CSS Modules, which offer similar functionalities. However, the choice of an alternative would depend on the specific needs of the project and the ease of migration. Given the project's current architecture and the depth of integration of styled-components, finding a suitable alternative that matches all the current functionalities might be challenging but not impossible.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While styled-components is a popular library with a large community, the JavaScript ecosystem is known for its rapid changes. If the library were to be abandoned, it could lead to security vulnerabilities or compatibility issues with newer versions of React or other dependencies. However, given its current popularity and active maintenance, this scenario is not highly likely in the near future.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of styled-components in the project's UI/UX, its deep integration, the availability of alternatives, and the likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of styled-components would likely be impactful to the project. The project would need to invest significant effort in refactoring and possibly rearchitecting the styling approach if the library were to be abandoned.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/webpack-env package provides TypeScript definitions for Webpack environment variables. Given that the project uses Webpack for building and bundling, these definitions are crucial for ensuring type safety and developer productivity. However, the direct impact on the project's functionality is limited to development experience rather than runtime behavior.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/webpack-env package is integrated into the project as a development dependency. It is used in conjunction with TypeScript and Webpack, which are central to the project's build process. Replacing it would require finding an alternative source for Webpack environment variable definitions, which could be non-trivial but not impossible.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative sources for TypeScript definitions, including DefinitelyTyped, which hosts a wide range of TypeScript definition files. While @types/webpack-env is the standard, other packages or custom definitions could potentially serve as replacements. The availability of alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacement.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. TypeScript definitions are relatively stable, and changes in Webpack's environment variables are infrequent. The project could continue using the existing definitions even if the package is abandoned, with minimal risk.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the scores and reasoning above, the abandonment of @types/webpack-env would have a moderate impact on the project. While it is important for development, the availability of alternatives and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action reduce its overall impact.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The react-test-renderer is used in the project for testing React components, specifically for snapshot testing in the SearchResultsLayout.test.tsx file. While testing is crucial for maintaining code quality and ensuring functionality, the direct impact of react-test-renderer on the project's core functionality is limited. It is a development dependency and does not affect the production build or the end-user experience directly. Therefore, its importance to the project is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The react-test-renderer is integrated into the project's testing suite, specifically for snapshot testing in the SearchResultsLayout.test.tsx file. Its usage is limited to a few test cases, indicating a shallow integration within the project. Replacing it would require updating the test cases that use it, but given its limited usage, the effort required would be minimal.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to react-test-renderer for testing React components, such as Enzyme and React Testing Library. These alternatives are widely used in the React community and provide similar or even enhanced functionality for testing React components. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace react-test-renderer if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. React-test-renderer is a stable library that is widely used in the React ecosystem. While any library can potentially be abandoned, the React ecosystem is robust, and the community would likely provide support or alternatives if react-test-renderer were to be abandoned.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of react-test-renderer to the project, its shallow integration, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of react-test-renderer would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could transition to an alternative testing library with minimal effort.",
