    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Axios is used extensively throughout the project for making HTTP requests to the KEN ALL API. It is a core dependency that facilitates the communication between the client and the API. The functionality provided by Axios is crucial for the project's operation, as it handles all the network requests, including fetching postal code data, bank information, and corporate data. Without Axios, the project would need to find an alternative way to handle these requests, which could significantly impact the project's functionality and development time.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Axios is deeply integrated into the project's codebase. It is used in the core functionality of the project, including the main class that interacts with the KEN ALL API. The project creates an Axios instance with custom configurations and uses it to make all the HTTP requests. This deep integration means that replacing Axios would require significant changes to the project's codebase, including the core logic for making requests and handling responses.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternative packages available for making HTTP requests in JavaScript, such as Fetch API and node-fetch, Axios offers a more comprehensive feature set, including request and response interception, automatic transforms for JSON data, and client-side support for protecting against XSRF. These features are utilized in the project, making it more difficult to find a suitable replacement that offers the same level of functionality and ease of use.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Axios's abandonment is relatively low. Axios is a widely used and well-maintained library with a large community and corporate sponsors. However, the JavaScript ecosystem is known for its rapid changes, and the emergence of new standards or libraries could potentially make Axios obsolete. Additionally, if Axios were to be abandoned or if critical security vulnerabilities were discovered, the project might need to consider alternatives.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role Axios plays in the project's functionality, its deep integration into the codebase, and the lack of direct alternatives that offer the same feature set, the abandonment of Axios would likely be directly impactful to the project. The project would need to undergo significant changes to replace Axios, which could affect its stability, development timeline, and maintenance efforts.",
    "impactful": true
  },
  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency @types/jest is used for TypeScript definitions for Jest, which is a testing framework. While testing is crucial for maintaining code quality, the direct functionality provided by @types/jest is not central to the core functionality of the kenall-js project, which is to provide a JavaScript client library for the KEN ALL API. Therefore, its importance to the project is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "@types/jest is integrated into the project as a devDependency, primarily used during the development and testing phases. Its integration is not deeply embedded into the core functionality or the main codebase of the project. Replacing it would mainly affect the testing setup, which, while important, does not directly impact the core functionality of the project.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives available for TypeScript definitions for Jest, such as directly using Jest without TypeScript definitions or switching to another testing framework that has TypeScript support. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace @types/jest if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the abandonment of @types/jest is low. The TypeScript ecosystem is stable, and Jest is a widely used testing framework with strong community support. Any changes that might affect @types/jest would likely be gradual and provide ample time for the project to adapt.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of @types/jest to the project, its shallow integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @types/jest would not likely be directly impactful to the kenall-js project.",
    "impactful": false
  },
  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @rollup/plugin-babel is used in the build process of the kenall-js project to transpile ES6+ code to a compatible version for the target environment. This is crucial for ensuring that the library can be used across different environments and browsers. Given that the project is a JavaScript client library, the ability to transpile code is fundamental to its functionality and distribution.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @rollup/plugin-babel in the kenall-js project is limited to the build process, specifically within the gulpfile.ts for bundling and transpiling the code. It is not deeply integrated into the core functionality of the library itself but plays a critical role in the build and deployment process. Replacing it would require adjustments to the build configuration but would not affect the core library code.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @rollup/plugin-babel for transpiling JavaScript code, such as Babel directly, Webpack with Babel loader, or other Rollup plugins designed for similar purposes. However, @rollup/plugin-babel is specifically optimized for use with Rollup, making it a preferred choice for projects that use Rollup for bundling. While alternatives exist, finding one that offers the same level of integration and efficiency with Rollup might be challenging.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The JavaScript ecosystem is stable, and Babel, along with its plugins, is widely used and supported. However, if the plugin were to be abandoned, the project might need to find an alternative or maintain a fork, but this scenario is unlikely in the near future.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @rollup/plugin-babel in the build process, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of forced action due to external changes, the abandonment of this dependency would be impactful but manageable. The project would need to adjust its build process, but the core functionality would remain unaffected.",
