      "reasoning": "The `react-select-async-paginate` dependency is used in multiple components within the project, including `SelectField.tsx`, `SelectField.test.tsx`, `websites.ts`, and `SortableSelect.tsx`. It provides functionality for asynchronous pagination in select fields, which is crucial for handling large datasets efficiently. Given its usage across different parts of the project, it plays a significant role in the user interface and data handling aspects.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into several components, indicating a moderate level of integration within the project's codebase. It is used for handling asynchronous data loading in select fields, which is a specific but important functionality. Replacing it would require changes in multiple components, but the integration is not deeply embedded in the core logic of the application.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative packages available that provide similar functionality for asynchronous data loading in select fields, such as `react-select` with custom async handling. However, finding a direct replacement that offers the same level of pagination support might require additional development effort. The availability of alternatives is moderate, but they may not offer the exact same features out of the box.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The dependency is specific to a particular functionality (asynchronous pagination in select fields) and does not directly interact with external services or APIs that are subject to frequent changes. However, if the dependency becomes abandoned, the project might need to consider alternatives to ensure long-term maintainability.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the functionality provided by `react-select-async-paginate`, its integration level, the availability of alternatives, and the likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of this dependency would be moderately impactful to the project. It is used in critical parts of the application for handling asynchronous data loading in select fields, but there are alternatives available that could potentially replace it with some development effort.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The `prettier-plugin-django-alpine` dependency is used for formatting Django and Alpine.js code in HTML files. Given the project's focus on managing deployments for OCW courses, the dependency's role is primarily in code formatting, which, while important for code quality and maintainability, is not directly related to the core functionality of the project. Therefore, its importance to the project is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of `prettier-plugin-django-alpine` in the project is minimal, as it is only referenced in the `.prettierrc.json` file for formatting purposes. There is no evidence of deep integration within the project's codebase, suggesting that replacing or removing this dependency would not require significant changes to the project's code.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives available for code formatting in HTML files, including other Prettier plugins and standalone formatting tools. These alternatives could provide similar functionality, making it relatively easy to replace `prettier-plugin-django-alpine` if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The dependency is used for code formatting, which is a stable and well-established practice. Changes in the external environment are unlikely to directly impact the need for or the functionality of code formatting tools.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of the dependency to the project, its minimal integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of `prettier-plugin-django-alpine` would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could easily switch to an alternative formatting tool without significant disruption.",

      "reasoning": "Ramda is used in multiple components and utility functions within the project, including MenuField, RelationField, test_util, and webpack configuration. Its functions are utilized for data manipulation, such as setting lens paths, dissociating paths, and mapping over arrays. Given its widespread use across different parts of the project, the functionality provided by Ramda is crucial for the project's data handling and manipulation tasks.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Ramda is integrated into several key components and utility functions, indicating a moderate level of integration depth. It is used for specific tasks like data manipulation and utility functions, rather than being a foundational layer of the project. While it is not deeply embedded in the core logic of the application, its presence in multiple files suggests a significant level of integration.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative libraries to Ramda that offer similar functional programming utilities, such as Lodash/fp, Underscore, and native JavaScript methods. These alternatives could potentially serve as suitable replacements, providing similar functionality. However, transitioning to an alternative would require refactoring the code where Ramda is currently used, which could be non-trivial given its usage across multiple components and utility functions.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Ramda's abandonment is moderate. While Ramda is a well-established library with a strong community, the JavaScript ecosystem is dynamic, and shifts in best practices or the emergence of more efficient libraries could influence the project's dependency choices. However, given Ramda's current stability and the project's specific use cases, such a change is not immediately foreseeable.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of Ramda's functionality to the project, its level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of Ramda would be impactful but not critically so. The project relies on Ramda for specific data manipulation tasks across multiple components, and while alternatives exist, transitioning would require significant refactoring. However, the impact is mitigated by the fact that Ramda is not deeply embedded in the core logic of the application.",
