    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @babel/runtime dependency is crucial for the project as it is a core part of the Babel toolchain, which is used for compiling JavaScript code. Babel is essential for ensuring compatibility across different environments and for using the latest JavaScript features. Given that the project is built on React and uses modern JavaScript features, the functionality provided by @babel/runtime is highly important for the project's build process and runtime performance.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @babel/runtime in the project is deep, as it is a devDependency that is likely used throughout the build process. Babel's runtime helpers are injected into the code during the build, making it difficult to replace without significant changes to the build configuration and potentially the codebase itself. This deep integration makes replacing @babel/runtime a complex task.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to Babel, such as TypeScript's compiler or other transpilers, they may not offer the same level of compatibility and feature support as Babel. Additionally, switching to an alternative would require significant changes to the project's build process and potentially the codebase. The availability of alternatives does not make the replacement process straightforward.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While Babel is a widely used tool with a large community, the JavaScript ecosystem is fast-moving, and changes in browser support or new JavaScript features could impact the need for Babel. However, given Babel's central role in the ecosystem, such changes are not imminent.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @babel/runtime to the project's build process and runtime performance, the depth of its integration, the complexity of finding and switching to alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @babel/runtime would likely be impactful to the project. The project relies on Babel for modern JavaScript features and compatibility, making it a critical dependency.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency 'rimraf' is used in the 'clean' script of the project, which is responsible for removing the 'dist' directory before a new build. This functionality is crucial for ensuring that the build process starts with a clean slate, preventing potential issues from leftover files. However, 'rimraf' is not directly involved in the core functionality of the project, which is related to theme compilation and component style preview.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of 'rimraf' in the project is limited to a single script command ('clean') in the package.json file. It is not deeply integrated into the project's codebase or its core functionalities. Replacing 'rimraf' would require minimal changes, primarily updating the 'clean' script to use an alternative method for directory removal.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to 'rimraf' that can perform directory removal, such as 'del', 'fs-extra', and native Node.js 'fs' module methods. These alternatives are widely used and well-maintained, making it relatively easy to replace 'rimraf' without significant impact on the project.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on 'rimraf's abandonment is low. 'rimraf' is a utility tool for directory removal, and its functionality is straightforward and not subject to frequent changes or dependencies on external factors. The project could easily switch to an alternative tool if necessary.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, 'rimraf' plays a role in the build process of the project by ensuring a clean build directory. However, its functionality is not central to the project's core features, and it is not deeply integrated into the codebase. There are also readily available alternatives that could replace 'rimraf' with minimal effort. Therefore, the abandonment of 'rimraf' would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency 'stylelint' is used in the project for linting CSS, Less, and SCSS files. Given the project's focus on implementing and previewing custom styles based on Ant-Design, maintaining consistent and error-free styles is crucial. However, the direct impact of 'stylelint' on the core functionality of the project, which revolves around theme compilation and component style preview, is moderate. It aids in maintaining code quality but is not directly involved in the core theme compilation process.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of 'stylelint' in the project is through npm scripts for linting and fixing style files. This indicates a relatively shallow integration, as it is used in a standalone manner for code quality checks rather than being deeply embedded in the project's core logic or build process. Replacing 'stylelint' would primarily involve updating these scripts and possibly the configuration files, which is manageable.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to 'stylelint' available in the ecosystem, such as 'ESLint' with CSS plugins, 'Prettier' for formatting, and other CSS linters like 'CSSLint'. These alternatives can provide similar functionality, making it feasible to replace 'stylelint' if necessary. The availability of these alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacing 'stylelint'.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on 'stylelint's abandonment is low. 'stylelint' is a well-established tool with a large community and corporate backing, making sudden abandonment unlikely. Additionally, the project's use of 'stylelint' is not highly specialized or dependent on unique features that would be hard to replace.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, 'stylelint' plays a supportive role in maintaining code quality but is not central to the project's core functionality. Its integration is shallow, and there are viable alternatives available. The likelihood of its abandonment forcing significant changes in the project is low. Therefore, the abandonment of 'stylelint' would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",
