    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "@angular/core is a fundamental dependency for any Angular project, providing the core functionality and services that Angular applications rely on. The project, mortgage-expense-calculator, is built using Angular, as indicated by the technologies used in the development process. The dependency is used extensively across the project, as shown in the dependency usage overview, indicating its critical role in the application's architecture and functionality.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @angular/core in the project is deep and pervasive. It is used in almost every component and service, as evidenced by the numerous imports across the codebase. This widespread usage suggests that replacing @angular/core would require significant refactoring of the project's codebase, affecting nearly every part of the application.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are other frameworks and libraries available for building web applications, such as React or Vue.js, they are not direct replacements for Angular. Migrating to a different framework would entail a complete rewrite of the application, not just a simple dependency swap. This makes the availability of suitable alternatives that provide the same functionality as @angular/core very limited.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. Angular is a widely used and actively maintained framework backed by Google. The ecosystem around Angular, including @angular/core, is robust, with a large community and regular updates. However, the theoretical abandonment of such a critical dependency would have a significant impact, necessitating immediate action.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role of @angular/core in the project's architecture, its deep integration across the codebase, the lack of direct alternatives, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of @angular/core would be highly impactful to the mortgage-expense-calculator project. The project would face significant challenges in maintaining functionality and would likely require a complete rewrite if forced to migrate to a different framework.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The rxjs-tslint dependency is used for linting and migrating RxJS code, specifically for ensuring proper imports and usage of RxJS operators. Given that the project uses RxJS for reactive programming, maintaining code quality and ensuring compatibility with RxJS versions is important. However, the core functionality of the mortgage expense calculator does not directly depend on rxjs-tslint, as it is more of a development tool rather than a runtime dependency.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of rxjs-tslint in the project is limited to the development process, specifically for linting and code migration tasks. It is not deeply integrated into the application's runtime code or core functionalities. Therefore, replacing or removing this dependency would not require significant changes to the project's codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to rxjs-tslint for linting and migrating RxJS code, such as eslint-plugin-rxjs and custom linting configurations. These alternatives can provide similar functionality, making it relatively easy to replace rxjs-tslint if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. RxJS is a stable library, and the migration tools provided by rxjs-tslint are primarily useful for transitioning between major versions of RxJS. Once the project is on a stable version of RxJS, the need for such migration tools diminishes.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance, integration, alternatives, and likelihood, the abandonment of rxjs-tslint would not likely be directly impactful to the project. It serves as a development tool rather than a core runtime dependency, and there are viable alternatives available. The project's core functionality and user experience would remain unaffected by its abandonment.",

      "reasoning": "TypeScript is a critical dependency for the project as it is used for type checking and compiling the Angular application. The project is built using Angular, which heavily relies on TypeScript for its development. The absence of TypeScript would make it impossible to compile and run the project, making it highly important.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "TypeScript is deeply integrated into the project's development environment. It is used in the Angular framework, which is the core technology of the project. The project's build and development processes are configured to use TypeScript, as seen in the package.json and .eslintrc files. Replacing TypeScript would require a significant overhaul of the project's codebase and build configuration.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to TypeScript, such as Babel for JavaScript compilation, they do not offer the same level of type safety and integration with Angular. TypeScript's features are specifically tailored for Angular development, making it difficult to find a suitable replacement that provides the same functionality and ease of use.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of TypeScript being abandoned is low, given its widespread adoption and support by major frameworks like Angular. However, if it were to be abandoned, the impact on the project would be significant due to the deep integration and importance of TypeScript in the Angular ecosystem.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role of TypeScript in the project's development and its deep integration with Angular, the abandonment of TypeScript would be highly impactful. The project relies on TypeScript for type checking and compilation, and finding a suitable replacement would be challenging. Therefore, the abandonment of TypeScript would likely be directly impactful to the project.",
