      "reasoning": "The rdflib library is used extensively throughout the project for handling RDF data, including reading and writing RDF/XML, Turtle, and N3 formats, as well as for SPARQL queries and real-time collaborative editing. Given the project's focus on submission form helpers that involve RDF data manipulation, the functionality provided by rdflib is crucial for the core operations of the project.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Rdflib is deeply integrated into the project, as evidenced by its usage across multiple files and functions, including validation, constraints, and data manipulation. The library is used for creating and manipulating RDF triples, namespaces, and for various RDF-related operations. This deep integration suggests that replacing rdflib would require significant refactoring of the codebase.",

    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are other RDF libraries available for JavaScript, such as rdf.js and N3.js, they may not offer the same level of functionality or compatibility with the existing codebase. Rdflib's specific features, such as its handling of RDF/XML and SPARQL queries, might not be fully replicated by alternative libraries, making it challenging to find a suitable replacement that would not require substantial changes to the project.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on rdflib's abandonment is moderate. While the library is actively maintained and widely used, the RDF ecosystem is evolving, and changes in standards or the emergence of more efficient libraries could potentially make rdflib obsolete. However, given its current stability and the project's reliance on it, such changes are not imminent.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role of rdflib in the project's RDF data handling and manipulation, its deep integration into the codebase, the challenges in finding a suitable replacement, and the moderate likelihood of external changes necessitating action, the abandonment of rdflib would likely be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The eslint-config-prettier package is used to disable ESLint rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier. This is crucial for maintaining code quality and consistency in the project, especially since the project includes linting as part of its development process. The package is directly referenced in the project's package.json and is used in the linting scripts, indicating its importance in the development workflow.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of eslint-config-prettier in the project is straightforward and limited to the ESLint configuration. It is used to extend the ESLint configuration to disable rules that conflict with Prettier. This level of integration is not deeply embedded in the project's codebase, making it relatively easy to replace or remove if necessary.",

    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to eslint-config-prettier, such as manually configuring ESLint rules to not conflict with Prettier or using other ESLint plugins that achieve similar functionality. However, eslint-config-prettier is widely used and well-maintained, making it a preferred choice for many projects. The availability of alternatives does not significantly impact the project's dependency on eslint-config-prettier.",

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. ESLint and Prettier are both stable and widely used tools in the JavaScript ecosystem, and any changes that would affect eslint-config-prettier would likely be gradual and well-communicated. Additionally, the project's dependency on eslint-config-prettier is not critical to its core functionality, reducing the impact of potential abandonment.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of eslint-config-prettier in maintaining code quality and consistency, its relatively shallow integration in the project, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of eslint-config-prettier would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could adapt by switching to an alternative or adjusting its ESLint configuration without significant disruption.",

      "reasoning": "The @babel/preset-env dependency is crucial for the project as it is used to transpile modern JavaScript code into a version that is compatible with the target environment (Node.js 14 in this case). This ensures that the project can leverage modern JavaScript features while maintaining compatibility with the specified Node.js version. Without it, the project might face compatibility issues or be unable to use modern JavaScript features effectively.",

The availability of alternatives is moderate, but the effort required to switch to an alternative could be substantial.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The project specifies a target Node.js version, and as long as this version is supported, the need to change the transpilation setup is minimal. However, if Node.js drops support for version 14 or if the project decides to target a newer version, the abandonment of @babel/preset-env could become a concern.",
      "score": 2

    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @babel/preset-env for the project's build process and the moderate difficulty of replacing it with an alternative, the abandonment of this dependency could be impactful. However, the current integration is not deeply embedded in the project's core functionality, and the likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action is low. Therefore, while the abandonment would be noteworthy, it is not highly impactful under the current circumstances.",
