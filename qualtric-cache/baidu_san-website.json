    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The hexo-deployer-git dependency is crucial for the deployment process of the San Website project. It is directly used in the deployment script as seen in the package.json file, which means that without it, the project cannot be deployed to its hosting platform. This makes the functionality provided by hexo-deployer-git highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of hexo-deployer-git in the San Website project is deep, as it is directly called in the deployment script within the package.json file. This indicates that the dependency is tightly coupled with the project's deployment process. Replacing it would require significant changes to the deployment workflow, making the integration depth high.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative packages available for deploying Hexo sites, such as hexo-deployer-rsync and hexo-deployer-ftp. However, these alternatives may not provide the exact same functionality or ease of use as hexo-deployer-git, especially for projects specifically configured for Git-based deployment. This makes finding a suitable replacement somewhat difficult.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the project could continue to use the current version of hexo-deployer-git even if it becomes abandoned, future updates or security patches would not be available, potentially leading to issues down the line.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of hexo-deployer-git to the deployment process of the San Website project, its deep integration, the difficulty in finding a suitable replacement, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would likely be directly impactful to the project.",
    "impactful": true
  },
  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The hexo-generator-tag dependency is used to generate tag pages for the San Website project. Given that the project is a documentation site for the San framework, tags are likely used to categorize and organize content, making this functionality important for user navigation and content discoverability. However, the core functionality of the site (documentation and examples) does not solely rely on tags, so while important, it is not critical.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of hexo-generator-tag appears to be straightforward, as it is a generator plugin for Hexo, which is used to build the site. The plugin is configured through the Hexo configuration and does not seem to be deeply embedded in the project's custom code. Replacing it would involve finding an alternative generator plugin and configuring it similarly, which is not overly complex.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative tag generator plugins available for Hexo, such as hexo-generator-tags and hexo-tag-cloud, which could potentially serve as suitable replacements. These alternatives offer similar functionality, making it relatively easy to replace hexo-generator-tag if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The Hexo ecosystem is stable, and the plugin is actively maintained. However, if the plugin were to be abandoned, the project could continue to function as is, with the only impact being the inability to update or fix potential issues with the tag generation functionality.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of tag generation for content organization, the ease of replacing the dependency, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of hexo-generator-tag would not likely be directly impactful to the San Website project. The project could continue to function with the current setup or switch to an alternative plugin with minimal disruption.",
    "impactful": false
  },
  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The hexo-server dependency is used for local development and previewing the San Website. It is essential for developers to test and view changes locally before deploying. However, it is not directly involved in the production build or deployment process. Therefore, while important for development, it is not critical for the final product.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The hexo-server is integrated into the project's npm scripts for starting the local server (`npm start` and `hexo s`). It is a straightforward command-line tool with minimal configuration, making its integration relatively shallow. Replacing it would mainly involve updating the npm scripts and possibly some configuration files.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to hexo-server for serving static sites locally, such as `http-server`, `live-server`, and `serve`. These alternatives provide similar functionality and can be easily integrated into the project with minimal changes. The availability of these alternatives makes replacing hexo-server relatively easy.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on hexo-server's abandonment is low. The dependency is used for local development, and its abandonment would not directly affect the production environment. The project could continue using the current version or switch to an alternative without significant impact.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of hexo-server for local development, the ease of replacing it, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of hexo-server would not be directly impactful to the project.
