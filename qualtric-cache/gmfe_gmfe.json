    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "React is a core dependency in the project, as evidenced by its extensive usage across multiple components and packages. The project is a component library built using React, and many of the components directly extend or use React's features. The functionality provided by React is fundamental to the project's operation, making it highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "React is deeply integrated into the project's codebase. It is used in almost every component, and many components directly extend React's Component class or use React hooks. The project's architecture and component structure are built around React, making it difficult to replace without significant refactoring.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are other front-end libraries and frameworks like Vue.js or Angular, they are not direct replacements for React. The project's components and architecture are specifically designed for React, and migrating to another framework would require a complete rewrite of the codebase. Additionally, the ecosystem and community support for React are extensive, making it a preferred choice for many developers.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of React being abandoned is extremely low. React is maintained by Facebook and has a large, active community. It is one of the most popular front-end libraries in use today, and its continued development and support are highly likely. External environmental changes forcing the project to act on React's abandonment are therefore very unlikely.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Given React's critical role in the project, its deep integration, the lack of direct alternatives, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of React would be highly impactful to the project. The project would need to undergo significant changes to adapt to a new framework, which would be a major undertaking.",
    "impactful": true
  },
  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The project uses stylelint as part of its linting process, specifically for linting .less files. This indicates that stylelint plays a role in maintaining code quality and consistency. However, the project's README and package.json do not suggest that stylelint is central to the project's core functionality or that its absence would severely impact the project's operation. Therefore, while important for code quality, it is not critical to the project's main features.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Stylelint is integrated into the project's linting process, as indicated by its presence in the lint-staged configuration for .less files. This suggests a moderate level of integration. However, the integration is limited to a specific part of the development process (linting) and does not appear to be deeply embedded in the project's core codebase or functionality.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to stylelint available, such as ESLint (with plugins for CSS), CSSLint, and others. These alternatives could potentially serve as suitable replacements, providing similar functionality for linting CSS and related languages. The availability of these alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacing stylelint.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on stylelint's abandonment is low. Stylelint is a well-established tool with a large community and is unlikely to be abandoned suddenly. Additionally, the project's reliance on stylelint is not so critical that its abandonment would necessitate immediate action, given the availability of alternatives.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, stylelint's abandonment would not likely be directly impactful to the project. While it plays a role in maintaining code quality, its integration is not deeply embedded in the project's core functionality, and there are viable alternatives available. The likelihood of needing to act on its abandonment is also low.",
    "impactful": false
  },
  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/react package provides TypeScript definitions for React, which is crucial for TypeScript projects using React. Given that the project gmfe/gmfe is a component library built with React and TypeScript, the functionality provided by @types/react is essential for type checking and IntelliSense support in the development environment. This makes the dependency highly important for the project's development and maintenance.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/react package is deeply integrated into the project as it is a fundamental part of the TypeScript and React development setup. Replacing it would require significant changes to the project's TypeScript configuration and potentially the way React components are written and used within the project. This level of integration makes it difficult to replace without considerable effort.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are no direct alternatives to @types/react that provide the same level of TypeScript support for React, the project could theoretically switch to using PropTypes or another type system. However, this would not be a suitable replacement for TypeScript's type checking and IntelliSense features, making it difficult to find a truly equivalent alternative.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The React ecosystem is stable, and TypeScript support for React is widely used and maintained. However, if the React team were to stop supporting TypeScript or if TypeScript were to fall out of favor, this could change.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @types/react to the project's development environment, the depth of its integration, the lack of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @types/react would be highly impactful to the project.",
