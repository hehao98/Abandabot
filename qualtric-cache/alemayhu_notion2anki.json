    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The html-to-text dependency is used in multiple components within the project, including handling paragraph blocks, toggle lists, todo lists, bullet lists, numbered lists, and bookmarks. It plays a crucial role in converting HTML content to plain text, which is essential for the project's functionality of converting Notion toggle lists to Anki cards. Given its widespread use and critical function, the dependency is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The html-to-text dependency is integrated into various components across the project, as evidenced by its usage in multiple files. It is used directly in the conversion process of HTML content to plain text, which is a core functionality of the project. The depth of its integration is significant, as it is not just a peripheral utility but a central part of the content processing pipeline.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are other packages available for converting HTML to text, such as html-to-md or html2plaintext, html-to-text offers advanced features like handling inline and block-level tags, tables, links, and word wrapping. These features are likely essential for the project's needs, making it difficult to find a suitable replacement that provides the same level of functionality and customization.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the dependency is actively maintained and widely used, changes in web standards or the emergence of a significantly better alternative could necessitate a switch. However, given the dependency's current stability and feature set, such a scenario is not highly likely in the near term.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the critical role of the html-to-text dependency in the project's core functionality, its deep integration across multiple components, the difficulty in finding a suitable replacement with the same level of functionality, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would likely be directly impactful to the project.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency @types/find-remove is a TypeScript type definition for the find-remove package, which is used for finding and removing files or directories. Given the project's focus on converting Notion toggle lists to Anki cards, the direct functionality of find-remove does not seem to be central to the core functionality of the project. It might be used for auxiliary tasks such as cleaning up temporary files. Therefore, its importance to the project is relatively low.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Since @types/find-remove is a type definition package, its integration into the project is limited to providing type support for the find-remove package. The depth of integration is shallow, as it does not directly affect the runtime behavior of the application but rather aids in development by ensuring type safety. Replacing it would primarily involve updating type definitions, which is a straightforward task.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives available for file and directory manipulation in Node.js, such as fs-extra, rimraf, and del. These alternatives also have their own TypeScript type definitions. Given the availability of these alternatives, replacing find-remove and its type definitions would not be difficult. The project could switch to another package with minimal changes to the codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the abandonment of @types/find-remove is low. Type definition packages are generally stable and do not frequently become abandoned. Even if @types/find-remove were to be abandoned, the impact would be minimal as the project could switch to another package or continue using the existing type definitions without issues.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the low importance of @types/find-remove to the project's core functionality, the shallow depth of its integration, the availability of alternative packages, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/react package provides TypeScript definitions for React, which is a core dependency for the project. Given that the project uses React for its frontend, the TypeScript definitions are crucial for ensuring type safety and developer productivity. However, since @types/react is a type definition package and not the actual React library, its importance is slightly lower than the React library itself.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/react package is integrated into the project as a devDependency, which means it is used during development but not in the production build. The integration depth is moderate because it affects the development experience but does not directly impact the runtime behavior of the application.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are no direct alternatives to @types/react for providing TypeScript definitions for React. However, if the project were to switch to a different UI library or framework, it might not need @types/react anymore. The availability of alternatives is low because @types/react is specifically designed for React.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the abandonment of @types/react is low. TypeScript definitions are generally stable, and the React ecosystem is mature. However, if React itself were to undergo significant changes, it might impact the relevance of @types/react.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @types/react for development, its moderate integration depth, the lack of direct alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @types/react would have a moderate impact on the project.
