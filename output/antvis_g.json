    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The jsdom dependency is crucial for the antvis/g project as it enables server-side rendering for the SVG renderer. This functionality is essential for testing and ensuring that the SVG renderer works correctly in a Node.js environment, which is a significant part of the project's testing suite.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "jsdom is deeply integrated into the project's testing infrastructure, particularly for the SVG renderer. It is used in multiple test files to create a DOM environment for rendering and comparing SVG outputs. Replacing jsdom would require significant changes to the testing setup and potentially the SVG renderer itself.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to jsdom, such as happy-dom or domino, they may not offer the same level of compatibility or feature set. jsdom's ability to emulate a web browser's environment closely makes it a preferred choice for projects requiring accurate DOM and HTML standards implementation. Finding a suitable replacement that matches jsdom's capabilities could be challenging.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on jsdom's abandonment is moderate. While jsdom is widely used and maintained, the JavaScript ecosystem is fast-evolving, and shifts in web standards or Node.js could impact jsdom's relevance or functionality. However, given its current stability and widespread adoption, such changes are not imminent.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given jsdom's critical role in the project's testing infrastructure, particularly for server-side rendering of the SVG renderer, its abandonment would likely be directly impactful. The dependency's deep integration and the lack of equally capable alternatives make it a cornerstone of the project's testing and rendering capabilities.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @rollup/plugin-strip is used to remove debugger statements and functions like assert.equal and console.log from the code. While this functionality is useful for cleaning up production code, it is not critical to the core functionality of the antvis/g project, which focuses on 2D / 3D graphics rendering. The project could still function without this plugin, albeit with potentially more verbose production code.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @rollup/plugin-strip is used in the rollup.config.mjs file, which is part of the build process. Its integration is limited to the build configuration and does not deeply affect the core codebase of the project. Replacing or removing this plugin would require minimal changes to the build configuration.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives available for removing debugger statements and console logs from JavaScript code, such as babel-plugin-transform-remove-console and babel-plugin-transform-remove-debugger. These alternatives could serve as suitable replacements with minimal changes to the build configuration.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The functionality provided by @rollup/plugin-strip is not subject to rapid changes in the JavaScript ecosystem, and the project could continue to use the plugin even if it were no longer actively maintained, as long as it remains compatible with the project's build process.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the low importance of the functionality provided by @rollup/plugin-strip to the core functionality of the antvis/g project, the minimal integration of the plugin in the project's codebase, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action on the plugin's abandonment, the abandonment of @rollup/plugin-strip would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The eslint-plugin-prettier is used to enforce code formatting standards by integrating Prettier with ESLint. While code formatting is important for maintainability and readability, it does not directly impact the core functionality of the project, which is rendering graphics. Therefore, its importance to the project is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of eslint-plugin-prettier is straightforward and limited to the development environment. It is used in the linting process, which is a part of the build and development workflow but not deeply integrated into the core codebase. Replacing it would require updating the ESLint configuration and possibly the CI/CD pipeline, but it would not require extensive changes to the project's core functionality.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to eslint-plugin-prettier, such as prettier-eslint, which can also integrate Prettier with ESLint. Additionally, Prettier can be run independently of ESLint. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace eslint-plugin-prettier if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. Prettier and ESLint are widely used and well-maintained tools, and any changes to their compatibility or functionality are likely to be gradual and well-documented. The project could continue using the current version of eslint-plugin-prettier even if it were abandoned, as long as it remains compatible with the project's other dependencies.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of code formatting to the project, the low level of integration of eslint-plugin-prettier, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of eslint-plugin-prettier would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",
