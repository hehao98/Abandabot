    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The ical-expander dependency is crucial for parsing and expanding ICS/iCal/Calendar data in the MMM-CalendarExt2 project. Given that the project is focused on displaying extended calendars and event views, the functionality provided by ical-expander is directly tied to the core feature set of the project. Without it, the project would lose its ability to process and display calendar data effectively.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of ical-expander in the MMM-CalendarExt2 project is relatively straightforward, as it is primarily used in the node_helper.js file to parse and expand calendar data. The usage is limited to a specific part of the codebase, indicating that while it is important, its integration is not deeply woven into the project's code. This suggests that replacing it, while not trivial, would not require extensive refactoring of the project's codebase.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative packages available that can parse and expand ICS/iCal/Calendar data, such as ical.js, which ical-expander itself wraps around. However, finding a package that offers the same level of functionality, especially in handling EXDATE, RRULE, and recurring events, might be challenging. The availability of alternatives is somewhat limited, making the replacement process potentially difficult.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the dependency is crucial for the project's functionality, the project could potentially switch to an alternative package or fork and maintain ical-expander itself if necessary. However, such a switch would require effort and resources, making it a significant but not immediate concern.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of ical-expander to the MMM-CalendarExt2 project's core functionality, the moderate difficulty of replacing it due to its integration and the availability of alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of ical-expander would likely be impactful to the project. However, the impact is mitigated by the project's ability to potentially switch to an alternative or maintain a fork of the dependency.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The 'globals' dependency is used in the project's ESLint configuration to define global variables for static analysis. While it plays a role in maintaining code quality and consistency, its functionality is not directly tied to the core features of the MMM-CalendarExt2 module, such as calendar display and event views. Therefore, its importance to the project is moderate but not critical.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The 'globals' dependency is integrated into the project's ESLint configuration files. Its usage is limited to defining global variables for static analysis purposes. Replacing it would require updating the ESLint configuration, but this is a relatively straightforward task with minimal impact on the overall codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative packages and methods for defining global variables in ESLint configurations, such as directly specifying globals in the ESLint config or using other packages that provide similar functionality. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace 'globals' if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the 'globals' dependency's abandonment is low. The dependency is used for static analysis in the development environment, and changes in this area are less likely to have a direct impact on the project's functionality or deployment.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of the 'globals' dependency to the project, its limited integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the MMM-CalendarExt2 project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @eslint/js dependency is used for linting JavaScript code, which is crucial for maintaining code quality and consistency in the project. However, the project's primary functionality revolves around calendar and event views, not code linting. Therefore, while important for development, it is not critical to the core functionality of the project.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project's linting configuration file (eslint.config.mjs). It is used to apply all ESLint rules to JavaScript files. The integration is straightforward and limited to the linting process, which is a separate aspect from the main application logic.",

    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @eslint/js for JavaScript linting, such as JSHint, JSLint, and Prettier. These alternatives can provide similar functionality and could be used as replacements if necessary. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace @eslint/js.",

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The project's core functionality does not depend on @eslint/js, and the linting process can be adapted to use alternative tools if needed.",
