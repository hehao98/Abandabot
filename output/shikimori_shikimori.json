    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The webpack-dev-server is crucial for the development environment of the Shikimori project, as it provides live reloading and fast in-memory access to webpack assets. This functionality significantly enhances the development experience by allowing developers to see changes in real-time without manually refreshing the browser. Given its role in the development process, the functionality provided by webpack-dev-server is highly important to the project.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The webpack-dev-server is integrated into the project's development workflow, as indicated by its usage in the README.md for running the development server. However, its integration is primarily through configuration files and npm scripts, which suggests that while it is a key component of the development environment, replacing it would not require extensive changes to the core codebase. The integration is deep in terms of development workflow but not deeply embedded in the project's source code.",

    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to webpack-dev-server, such as Vite, Parcel, and Snowpack, which offer similar functionalities like live reloading and fast development server capabilities. These alternatives are actively maintained and could serve as suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace webpack-dev-server, provided that the project is willing to invest time in migrating to a new tool.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While webpack-dev-server is a popular tool, the JavaScript ecosystem is known for its rapid evolution, and new tools frequently emerge that could offer better performance or features. However, given the current stability and widespread use of webpack-dev-server, such a scenario is not imminent but remains a possibility in the long term.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of webpack-dev-server to the development workflow, the moderate depth of its integration, the availability of alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of webpack-dev-server would be impactful to the project. However, the impact could be mitigated by migrating to an alternative tool, which would require some effort but is feasible.",

      "reasoning": "The @babel/plugin-proposal-partial-application is used in the babel.config.js file, indicating it's part of the build process. However, the project's README and other provided context do not highlight any critical functionality that directly depends on this plugin. It seems to be one of several Babel plugins used, suggesting its role, while important for the build process, is not uniquely critical to the project's core functionality.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The plugin is integrated into the project's Babel configuration, which is a standard part of the build process for JavaScript projects. Its integration appears to be straightforward, with no evidence of deep or complex integration within the project's codebase. Replacing or removing it would likely require adjustments to the Babel configuration but would not necessitate extensive changes across the codebase.",

      "reasoning": "There are several Babel plugins and other JavaScript compilation tools available that could potentially offer similar functionality or workarounds to achieve the same results. The ecosystem around JavaScript compilation is rich and constantly evolving, providing a variety of alternatives for handling partial application and other advanced JavaScript features.",

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The JavaScript ecosystem is stable, and Babel, as a widely used tool, is unlikely to undergo changes that would suddenly make this plugin obsolete or unsupported. Additionally, the plugin's functionality is not tied to rapidly changing external standards or technologies.",

    "reasoning": "Considering the provided context, the @babel/plugin-proposal-partial-application plugin plays a role in the project's build process but does not appear to be uniquely critical or deeply integrated into the project's core functionality. There are alternatives available, and the likelihood of external changes forcing action on this dependency is low. Therefore, the abandonment of this dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

      "reasoning": "The dependency `core-js` is used to provide polyfills for modern JavaScript features, ensuring compatibility across different browsers. Given its usage in the entry point of the application (`app/packs/entrypoints/application.js`), it plays a crucial role in the project's ability to function correctly across various environments. Without it, the application might not work as expected in older browsers, which could significantly impact the user experience.",
