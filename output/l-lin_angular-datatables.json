    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @angular/common package is a core part of Angular, providing essential services and directives such as HttpClient, which is used extensively throughout the project for making HTTP requests. Given its fundamental role in Angular applications and its widespread usage in this project, the functionality provided by @angular/common is highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "@angular/common is deeply integrated into the project, as evidenced by its usage in numerous components and services across the codebase. Replacing it would require significant refactoring of the project's code, including changes to how HTTP requests are made and how certain Angular features are utilized.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to specific functionalities provided by @angular/common (e.g., other HTTP client libraries), there is no direct replacement that offers the same level of integration with Angular's ecosystem. Finding and integrating a suitable alternative would be challenging and time-consuming.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given that @angular/common is a core part of Angular, maintained by the Angular team, the likelihood of it being abandoned is extremely low. However, if it were to be abandoned, it would likely be due to a major shift in the Angular framework itself, which would force the project to act.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the critical role of @angular/common in the Angular ecosystem and its deep integration into the project, its abandonment would be highly impactful. The project relies heavily on its functionalities, and finding a suitable replacement would be difficult. However, the likelihood of abandonment is low, given its status as a core Angular package.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency 'datatables.net-buttons-dt' provides essential functionality for adding buttons to DataTables in the Angular project. This includes file export, print view, and column visibility features, which are crucial for the project's data table interactions. Given the project's focus on integrating DataTables with Angular, the functionality provided by this dependency is highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project through both the package.json file and the angular.json configuration, indicating it is used in the build process. It is also imported and used in specific components, such as the buttons-extension.component.ts, showing a direct usage in the project's codebase. This level of integration suggests that replacing the dependency would require significant changes to the project's configuration and code.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are other libraries and packages that offer similar functionality for adding buttons to tables, the specific integration and styling provided by 'datatables.net-buttons-dt' are tailored for DataTables. Finding a replacement that offers the same level of integration and compatibility with DataTables and Angular could be challenging. However, the existence of alternative packages that provide similar functionality reduces the difficulty of finding a replacement.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given that the project itself is no longer maintained, as indicated in the project's README, the likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The project's current state suggests it is not actively being developed or updated, reducing the impact of any dependency changes.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the functionality provided by 'datatables.net-buttons-dt' to the project, the depth of its integration, the availability of alternatives, and the project's current maintenance status, the abandonment of this dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project's lack of active maintenance means that changes in dependencies are less likely to affect its functionality or require immediate action.",
    "impactful": false
  },
  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/jquery package provides TypeScript definitions for jQuery, which is a fundamental library used in the project for DataTables functionality. Given that jQuery is directly used in the project and is essential for DataTables to function, the TypeScript definitions are crucial for ensuring type safety and development efficiency.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/jquery package is integrated into the project as a devDependency, indicating its use during development rather than in the production build. However, since jQuery is a core dependency for DataTables, replacing @types/jquery would require ensuring that any alternative or updated TypeScript definitions are fully compatible with the project's use of jQuery. This integration, while not deeply embedded in the production code, is critical for development workflows.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative TypeScript definition packages for jQuery, but they may not be as widely used or maintained as @types/jquery. The availability of alternatives is somewhat limited by the need for compatibility with the specific version of jQuery used in the project. However, the community around jQuery and TypeScript is active, which could facilitate finding or creating suitable replacements if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the abandonment of @types/jquery is relatively low. The TypeScript ecosystem is stable, and the package is widely used, which reduces the risk of sudden abandonment. However, changes in jQuery or TypeScript itself could indirectly affect the need for updated definitions.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @types/jquery for development efficiency and type safety, its integration into the project's development workflow, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @types/jquery would be impactful but not critically so. The project could manage with alternative solutions or updates if necessary.",
