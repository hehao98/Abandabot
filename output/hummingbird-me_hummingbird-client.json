    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @floating-ui/react library is used for positioning floating elements in the React application. Given the nature of web applications, especially those with complex UIs like Kitsu, the ability to position elements such as tooltips, dropdowns, and modals accurately is crucial. The library's functionality directly impacts the user experience and interface design, making it highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration depth of @floating-ui/react in the project can be considered moderate. While it is a key library for UI elements, the project's structure and the use of other UI libraries like @radix-ui/react-dialog and @popperjs/core suggest that there might be some flexibility in replacing it. However, the specific use cases and customizations for floating elements could make the integration more complex.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @floating-ui/react, such as Popper.js (which is already a dependency in the project) and Tippy.js. These libraries offer similar functionalities for positioning floating elements. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace @floating-ui/react, provided that the project's specific needs and customizations can be accommodated by these alternatives.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The library is actively maintained and widely used in the React ecosystem. However, changes in React itself or in web standards could potentially impact the library's relevance or functionality.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @floating-ui/react for the project's UI elements, its moderate integration depth, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would be impactful but not critically so. The project could transition to an alternative library with some effort, but the functionality provided by @floating-ui/react is crucial for the user experience.",
    "impactful": true
  },
  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The postcss-easings dependency is used to replace easing names with cubic-bezier() functions in CSS. This functionality is useful for ensuring consistent and smooth animations across the project. However, the project's README and code snippets do not indicate heavy reliance on complex animations or transitions, suggesting that while useful, the dependency is not critical to the core functionality of the project.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project through the postcss.config.js file, which is a common configuration file for PostCSS plugins. This indicates a straightforward integration that does not deeply intertwine with the project's core logic or components. Replacing or removing this dependency would likely require minimal changes to the project's codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages and methods available for handling CSS animations and transitions, including manual cubic-bezier definitions and other PostCSS plugins. The availability of these alternatives suggests that replacing postcss-easings would not be particularly difficult, provided that the project's animation requirements are not overly complex.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The dependency is focused on a specific aspect of CSS processing (easing functions), and changes in web standards or browser support are unlikely to directly impact its utility or necessitate immediate action.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the scores and reasoning provided for each of the four questions, it is clear that the abandonment of the postcss-easings dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The functionality it provides is useful but not critical, its integration is not deeply embedded in the project's codebase, there are readily available alternatives, and external environmental changes are unlikely to force action.",
    "impactful": false

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The react-icons package is used across multiple components in the project, including UI elements like buttons, modals, and alerts. It provides essential icons that enhance the user interface and user experience. Given its widespread use, the functionality provided by react-icons is important to the project.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "react-icons is integrated into various components across the project, as seen in the dependency usage overview. However, its usage is straightforward, primarily involving importing and using specific icons. This suggests that while it is used in many places, its integration is not deeply complex.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative icon libraries available for React, such as Material-UI Icons, FontAwesome, and others. These libraries offer similar functionalities and could serve as suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace react-icons.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the project could continue using react-icons even if it were abandoned, the availability of active alternatives might encourage a switch to ensure long-term support and updates.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of react-icons to the project's UI, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternative packages, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of react-icons would be impactful but not critically so. The project could manage a transition to an alternative with some effort.",
