    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @mate-academy/backstop-config dependency is used for configuring BackstopJS, which is essential for testing students' HTML tasks in the project. Given that the project is focused on frontend practice and layout solutions, the ability to test these layouts accurately is crucial. Therefore, the functionality provided by this dependency is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project through a single configuration file (backstopConfig.js). The integration is straightforward, with the dependency being required and its configurations extended or modified as needed. This indicates a relatively shallow integration, making it less difficult to replace if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to BackstopJS for visual regression testing, such as Percy, Applitools, and others. However, the specific configuration provided by @mate-academy/backstop-config might be tailored to the project's needs, making direct alternatives less suitable without additional customization.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The dependency is specific to the project's testing needs and does not directly interact with external systems or services that could change independently.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the dependency for testing, its relatively shallow integration, the availability of alternatives with some customization needed, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @mate-academy/backstop-config would be impactful but manageable. The project would need to find or create a suitable replacement for its testing configuration, which could require some effort but is not insurmountable.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @mate-academy/bemlint package is used for linting BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology in the project. Given that the project is a layout catalog, adhering to BEM methodology is crucial for maintaining a consistent and scalable CSS structure. The package ensures that the BEM rules are followed, which is important for the project's maintainability and scalability. However, the project's README is not found, which limits the ability to fully assess the importance of this dependency.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @mate-academy/bemlint package is listed as a devDependency in the package.json file, indicating it is used during development rather than in the production build. The package is integrated into the project's linting process, as seen in the 'lint' script which runs bemlint among other linting tools. While it is integrated into the development workflow, it does not appear to be deeply embedded in the project's core functionality or production code.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative BEM linting tools available, such as postcss-bem-linter and stylelint-bem. These alternatives could potentially serve as suitable replacements for @mate-academy/bemlint, providing similar functionality for enforcing BEM methodology. The availability of these alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacing the dependency.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The BEM methodology is a well-established approach in CSS, and changes in the web development ecosystem are unlikely to render BEM obsolete in the near future. Additionally, the project's focus on layout suggests a stable foundation that is less susceptible to rapid changes in technology.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of BEM methodology in maintaining a consistent and scalable CSS structure, the @mate-academy/bemlint package plays a significant role in the project's development process. However, its integration is limited to the development workflow, and there are viable alternatives available. The likelihood of external changes necessitating action on the dependency's abandonment is low. Therefore, while the dependency is important, its abandonment would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

      "reasoning": "Parcel is used as the primary bundler for the project, handling the transformation of SCSS files directly linked in HTML. This functionality is crucial for the development and deployment process, as it ensures that the project's styles are correctly processed and applied. Given its role in the build process, the functionality provided by Parcel is highly important to the project.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Parcel is integrated into the project's build and development scripts, as seen in the package.json file. It is used for starting the development server and building the project for deployment. The integration is deep, as changing the bundler would require updating the build scripts and potentially the way SCSS files are linked and processed in the project.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Parcel, such as Webpack, Rollup, and Vite, which could serve as suitable replacements. These alternatives also support SCSS processing and offer similar or additional features. However, switching to an alternative would require some effort to reconfigure the build process and possibly adjust the project's structure to fit the new bundler's requirements.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Parcel's abandonment is moderate. While Parcel is a popular tool, the JavaScript ecosystem is fast-moving, and new bundlers with better performance or features could emerge. Additionally, if Parcel were to be abandoned, it might not receive security updates or support, which could eventually force the project to switch to an alternative.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given Parcel's crucial role in the project's build process and its deep integration, its abandonment would likely be impactful. However, the availability of alternatives and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action suggest that while the impact would be significant, it might not be immediate or insurmountable.",
