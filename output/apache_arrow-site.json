      "reasoning": "Webpack is used to bundle JavaScript and CSS libraries, which is a critical part of the build process for the Apache Arrow website. The project's README explicitly mentions the need for Webpack to maintain dependent JavaScript and CSS libraries, indicating its importance in the project's workflow.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Webpack is integrated into the project's build process, as evidenced by its usage in the Rakefile for generating the main JavaScript file. The project has a dedicated webpack.config.js file, indicating a moderate level of integration. However, the project does not seem to heavily customize Webpack's configuration, suggesting that the integration is not overly complex.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Webpack, such as Parcel, Rollup, and Browserify, which can also bundle JavaScript and CSS files. These alternatives are widely used and could potentially serve as suitable replacements. However, switching to an alternative would require some effort to adjust the build process and configuration.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given Webpack's widespread use and active maintenance, the likelihood of it being abandoned in the near future is low. However, if Webpack were to be abandoned, the project would need to act to ensure the build process remains functional, especially if there are security or compatibility issues with the abandoned version.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of Webpack in the project's build process, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of Webpack would likely be impactful to the project. However, the impact could be mitigated by switching to an alternative bundler.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "jQuery is a widely-used JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversal, event handling, and animation. Given the project's use of webpack for managing JavaScript and CSS libraries, jQuery's functionality could be important for simplifying DOM manipulation and AJAX calls. However, modern JavaScript and frameworks have reduced the necessity of jQuery for new projects. The project's README does not explicitly mention jQuery, suggesting its role might not be critical.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The project uses webpack, which allows for modular JavaScript. This suggests that jQuery, if used, is likely integrated in a modular way rather than being deeply embedded throughout the codebase. This modularity would make it easier to replace jQuery with vanilla JavaScript or another library.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to jQuery, including vanilla JavaScript, which has evolved to cover much of jQuery's functionality. Other libraries like Axios for AJAX calls and modern frameworks like React or Vue.js can also serve as replacements. The availability of these alternatives makes replacing jQuery feasible.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on jQuery's abandonment is moderate. While jQuery is still widely used, the trend towards modern JavaScript and frameworks could eventually make jQuery obsolete. However, this is a gradual process, and immediate action is unlikely to be required.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the scores and reasoning above, jQuery's abandonment would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project's use of webpack suggests a modular approach to JavaScript, making it easier to replace jQuery if necessary. Additionally, the availability of alternatives and the trend towards modern JavaScript reduce the potential impact of jQuery's abandonment.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Popper.js is a dependency used in conjunction with Bootstrap for handling tooltips and popovers. Given that the Apache Arrow website is a static site generated using Jekyll and relies on Bootstrap for its UI components, Popper.js plays a crucial role in ensuring the functionality of these components. However, the direct impact of Popper.js on the core functionality of the website is limited to UI enhancements. Therefore, while important, it is not critical to the website's core operations.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Popper.js is integrated into the project as a dependency for Bootstrap. Its usage is primarily through Bootstrap's components, meaning it is not directly referenced in the project's custom code. This level of integration suggests that replacing Popper.js would require changes to how Bootstrap is used or finding an alternative that works seamlessly with Bootstrap, which could be moderately challenging.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Popper.js, such as Tippy.js, that offer similar or enhanced functionality for tooltips and popovers. These alternatives are well-maintained and could potentially serve as suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacing Popper.js, should the need arise.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Popper.js's abandonment is relatively low. Popper.js is a stable library with a specific use case, and its functionality is not likely to be affected by changes in web standards or browser updates in the near future. Additionally, the project's reliance on Popper.js is through Bootstrap, which would likely address any significant issues with Popper.js in its updates.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of Popper.js to the project's UI components, the moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of Popper.js would not likely be directly impactful to the Apache Arrow website. The project could transition to an alternative with moderate effort, and the core functionality of the website would remain unaffected.",
