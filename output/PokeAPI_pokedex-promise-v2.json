    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/node package provides TypeScript definitions for Node.js, which are crucial for TypeScript projects that interact with Node.js APIs. Given that pokedex-promise-v2 is a Node.js library that uses TypeScript, the absence of these definitions would lead to a lack of type safety and potentially runtime errors. This makes the functionality provided by @types/node highly important to the project.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/node package is deeply integrated into the project's development environment, as it is listed in the devDependencies of the package.json file. This indicates that it is used during the development process, likely for type checking and ensuring that the code correctly interacts with Node.js APIs. Replacing it would require finding an alternative that provides the same level of type definitions and ensuring that all TypeScript code is compatible with the new definitions.",

    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are no direct alternatives to @types/node that provide the same comprehensive TypeScript definitions for Node.js APIs. While it might be possible to manually define types or use a different approach to type checking, these alternatives would be significantly more labor-intensive and less reliable than using @types/node.",

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The Node.js ecosystem is stable, and @types/node is maintained by the DefinitelyTyped community, which is known for its reliability and responsiveness to changes in the Node.js API. However, if Node.js were to undergo significant changes that are not reflected in @types/node, the project might need to find an alternative solution.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @types/node to the project's development process, the depth of its integration, the lack of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @types/node would be highly impactful to the pokedex-promise-v2 project. It would compromise the project's type safety and potentially lead to runtime errors, making it difficult to maintain and develop the library.",

This functionality is crucial for the project as it ensures that the data fetched from the Pok\u00e9API is correctly typed, enhancing the development experience and reducing runtime errors.

It is used to process JSON schemas and generate TypeScript types. The integration is deep but localized to the type generation functionality.

These alternatives provide similar functionality and could potentially replace quicktype-core with some adjustments to the type generation process. The availability of these alternatives makes the replacement of quicktype-core feasible, though it would require some effort to adapt the project to use a different library.",

The project's use of quicktype-core is specific to type generation from JSON schemas, a task that is not highly susceptible to external changes. Additionally, the project's dependency on quicktype-core is not exposed to end-users, reducing the impact of any potential abandonment.",
