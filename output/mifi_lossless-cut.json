    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency 'type-fest' provides essential TypeScript types that are used across the project. Given the project's reliance on TypeScript for type safety and development efficiency, the functionality provided by 'type-fest' is crucial. It includes utility types that simplify complex type manipulations, which are likely used throughout the codebase to ensure type correctness and reduce boilerplate code.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration depth of 'type-fest' in the project appears to be moderate. While it provides essential utility types, the project's core functionality is not solely dependent on it. The dependency is likely used in various parts of the codebase for type definitions and manipulations, but replacing it would not require a complete overhaul of the project's architecture. However, it would still require significant effort to replace all instances where 'type-fest' types are used.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative packages and TypeScript's built-in utility types that could potentially replace 'type-fest'. However, 'type-fest' offers a comprehensive collection of types that are not all available in TypeScript's standard library or other utility type packages. Finding and integrating suitable alternatives for all the types provided by 'type-fest' could be time-consuming and might not cover all use cases as effectively.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. 'type-fest' is a well-maintained library with a strong community backing. However, the risk of abandonment cannot be entirely ruled out, especially if the maintainers decide to discontinue the project or if significant changes in TypeScript's type system make 'type-fest' obsolete.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of 'type-fest' to the project, the moderate depth of its integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of 'type-fest' would be impactful but not catastrophic. The project would need to invest time in finding and integrating alternatives, but the core functionality would remain unaffected.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The screenfull dependency is used to enable fullscreen mode for the video player in the LosslessCut application. While this feature enhances user experience by allowing users to view videos in fullscreen, it is not a core functionality of the application, which primarily focuses on lossless video/audio editing. Therefore, the importance of screenfull to the project is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of screenfull in the project is minimal. It is used in a single function to toggle fullscreen mode for the video player. The dependency is not deeply integrated into the project's codebase, and its usage is straightforward, making it relatively easy to replace or remove.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available that provide similar fullscreen functionality, such as fullscreen-api and fullscreen-polyfill. These alternatives could serve as suitable replacements for screenfull, offering the same or similar functionality with minimal changes to the codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The Fullscreen API is a standard web API, and while screenfull provides a cross-browser wrapper for it, the core functionality is unlikely to change significantly. Additionally, the project could directly use the Fullscreen API if necessary, reducing the impact of screenfull's abandonment.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of the fullscreen functionality, the minimal integration of screenfull in the project, the availability of alternative packages, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of screenfull would not likely be directly impactful to the LosslessCut project.",
    "impactful": false

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. It is used in the project to enforce coding standards and catch potential errors. While it is important for maintaining code quality, the core functionality of the project, which is lossless video/audio editing, does not directly depend on ESLint. Therefore, its importance to the project's primary functionality is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "ESLint is integrated into the project's development workflow, as indicated by the 'lint' script in the package.json file. However, it is not deeply integrated into the core functionality of the application itself. The project could continue to function without ESLint, albeit with potentially lower code quality. Therefore, the difficulty of replacing ESLint, considering the depth of its integration, is low.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to ESLint for JavaScript linting, such as JSHint, JSLint, and Prettier (for code formatting). These alternatives could serve as suitable replacements and provide similar functionality. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace ESLint if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on ESLint's abandonment is low. ESLint is a widely used and actively maintained tool with a large community and corporate backing. While it is not impossible for it to become abandoned, the current state of the project and its ecosystem suggest that this is unlikely in the near future.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of ESLint to the project's code quality, the ease of replacing it, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of its abandonment, the abandonment of ESLint would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could continue to function and maintain its core features without ESLint, although code quality might suffer.",
