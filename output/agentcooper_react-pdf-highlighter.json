    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency `pdfjs-dist` is crucial for the project `react-pdf-highlighter` as it is built on top of PDF.js for PDF annotation features. The project's README explicitly mentions that it is built on top of PDF.js, indicating that the core functionality of PDF rendering and manipulation is dependent on `pdfjs-dist`. Without this dependency, the project cannot fulfill its primary purpose of PDF annotation.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of `pdfjs-dist` in the project is deep, as evidenced by its usage across multiple components and the inclusion of its CSS. It is used in `PdfLoader.tsx` for loading and managing PDF documents, in `HighlightLayer.tsx` for handling PDF viewer interactions, and its CSS is imported in the project's style files. This widespread usage indicates that replacing `pdfjs-dist` would require significant changes to the project's codebase.",

    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are other libraries available for PDF rendering and manipulation, such as `pdf-lib` and `pdfmake`, they may not offer the same level of functionality or compatibility as `pdfjs-dist`, especially for web-based PDF annotation. The project's specific requirements for PDF annotation and the integration depth of `pdfjs-dist` make finding a suitable alternative challenging.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. `pdfjs-dist` is maintained by Mozilla, a reputable organization, which reduces the risk of abandonment. However, changes in web standards or browser support could necessitate updates or changes to the dependency.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role of `pdfjs-dist` in the project's core functionality, the depth of its integration, the challenges in finding suitable alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of external changes necessitating action, the abandonment of `pdfjs-dist` would likely be directly impactful to the project.",

      "reasoning": "TypeScript is used as a development dependency in the project, primarily for type checking and compiling TypeScript code to JavaScript. Given that the project is a React component library, TypeScript plays a crucial role in ensuring type safety and improving developer experience. However, its functionality is not directly exposed in the final product, which limits its importance to the development phase rather than the runtime execution of the project.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "TypeScript is integrated into the project's build process, as evidenced by the 'compile' script in the package.json file which uses 'tsc' (TypeScript compiler). The project also includes TypeScript type definitions and uses TypeScript for development. However, the integration is not deeply embedded into the core functionality of the project, as the main functionality is provided by React and PDF.js. Replacing TypeScript would require changes to the build process and potentially the way types are handled, but it would not affect the core functionality of the project.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to TypeScript for type checking and compiling JavaScript code, such as Flow, Babel with type checking plugins, or even using plain JavaScript with JSDoc comments for type annotations. These alternatives could provide similar functionality, though they might require adjustments in the development workflow and potentially a different approach to type safety. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace TypeScript, though each alternative comes with its own set of trade-offs.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on TypeScript's abandonment is relatively low. TypeScript is widely used and supported by a large community, and its abandonment would likely be a gradual process with ample warning. Additionally, the project could continue to use the last stable version of TypeScript for a significant period, even if active development were to cease. However, changes in the JavaScript ecosystem or in the tools and libraries that the project depends on could indirectly increase the likelihood of needing to address TypeScript's abandonment.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of TypeScript to the development process, the depth of its integration, the availability of alternatives, and the likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of TypeScript would have a moderate impact on the project. It would require adjustments to the build process and potentially the way types are handled, but it would not directly affect the core functionality of the project. Therefore, while the abandonment would be noteworthy, it would not be directly impactful to the project's runtime execution or its end users.",

Given that react-pdf-highlighter is a React component library and uses TypeScript, the @types/react package is essential for ensuring type safety and developer experience. Without it, developers would lose type checking and autocompletion features, which are vital for productivity and code quality.",

    "reasoning": "Given the critical role of @types/react in ensuring type safety and developer experience in TypeScript projects using React, its abandonment would be highly impactful. The project relies on TypeScript for development, and losing TypeScript definitions for React would significantly degrade the development experience and potentially introduce bugs. The deep integration of @types/react into the project's build process and the lack of suitable alternatives further underscore its importance.",
