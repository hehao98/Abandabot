    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The blake2b-wasm dependency is used extensively throughout the snarkjs project for cryptographic hashing operations, which are critical for the zkSNARK and PLONK schemes. It is used in key generation, contribution verification, and other core functionalities. Given its widespread use and the critical nature of its functionality, the dependency is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The blake2b-wasm dependency is deeply integrated into the snarkjs project, as evidenced by its usage across multiple files and functions. It is used in various critical operations such as hashing for contributions, key generation, and verification processes. The dependency is not just a peripheral utility but is embedded in the core functionalities of the project, making its replacement or removal challenging.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are other cryptographic hashing libraries available, finding a suitable replacement that matches the performance and compatibility of blake2b-wasm, especially in a WebAssembly context, could be challenging. The project's reliance on WebAssembly for performance means that alternatives would need to offer similar performance characteristics and be compatible with the existing codebase.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the dependency is critical, the project could potentially switch to another hashing library if necessary. However, given the dependency's specific use of WebAssembly for performance, any change would require significant effort to ensure compatibility and performance are maintained.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role of blake2b-wasm in the snarkjs project for cryptographic hashing operations, its deep integration into the project's core functionalities, the challenges in finding a suitable alternative, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would likely be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. While it is useful for maintaining code quality, the core functionality of the snarkjs project, which is a JavaScript and Pure Web Assembly implementation of zkSNARK and PLONK schemes, does not directly depend on ESLint for its cryptographic operations or zkSNARK functionalities. ESLint's role is more about code style and linting, which, while beneficial, is not critical to the project's primary objectives.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of ESLint in the snarkjs project appears to be minimal, primarily used for linting purposes as indicated by the .eslintrc.cjs configuration file. There is no evidence of deep integration within the project's core functionalities or critical paths. Replacing ESLint would likely involve updating the linting configuration and possibly the CI/CD pipeline, but it would not require significant changes to the project's core codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to ESLint available in the JavaScript ecosystem, such as Prettier, JSHint, and TSLint (for TypeScript projects). These tools offer similar functionality for code linting and style enforcement. Given the availability of these alternatives, replacing ESLint would not be particularly difficult, as the project could switch to another linter with relatively minor adjustments to the configuration and setup.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on ESLint's abandonment is low. ESLint is a widely used and actively maintained tool within the JavaScript community. Even if ESLint were to be abandoned, the impact on the snarkjs project would be minimal due to the availability of alternative linting tools and the non-critical nature of ESLint's role in the project.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, ESLint's abandonment would not likely be directly impactful to the snarkjs project. The tool's role is more about maintaining code quality and style, which, while important, is not critical to the project's core functionalities. The minimal integration, availability of alternatives, and low likelihood of external changes forcing action further support the conclusion that the impact would be low.",

      "reasoning": "The @rollup/plugin-node-resolve dependency is used in the build process of snarkjs, specifically in the rollup configuration files for building the browser and iife versions of the library. While it plays a crucial role in the build process, the core functionality of snarkjs (zkSNARKs implementation) does not directly depend on it. Therefore, its importance to the project's core functionality is moderate.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project's build process through the rollup configuration files. It is used to resolve modules using the Node resolution algorithm. The integration is not deeply embedded into the core codebase but is essential for the build process. Replacing it would require adjustments to the build configuration but would not affect the core functionality of the library.",
