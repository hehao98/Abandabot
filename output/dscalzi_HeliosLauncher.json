    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @electron/remote module is used in the Helios Launcher project to interact with the main process from the renderer process. It is used for critical functionalities such as managing window actions (close, minimize, maximize) and accessing the user data path. Given its role in essential features, the functionality provided by @electron/remote is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @electron/remote module is integrated into the project's codebase in several key areas, including window management and configuration settings. Its usage is spread across different parts of the application, indicating a deep integration. Replacing it would require significant changes to the codebase, affecting multiple functionalities.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to @electron/remote, such as using ipcRenderer for inter-process communication, these alternatives may not provide the same level of convenience or direct access to main process objects. The availability of suitable alternatives is limited, and switching to them would require substantial code refactoring.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the critical role of @electron/remote in the project and the lack of equally convenient alternatives, the likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. However, the project could potentially adapt to changes by refactoring the code to use alternative methods for inter-process communication.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @electron/remote to the project's functionality, its deep integration into the codebase, the limited availability of suitable alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @electron/remote would likely be impactful to the Helios Launcher project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency 'discord-rpc-patch' is used to integrate Discord Rich Presence into the Helios Launcher, enhancing user experience by displaying the launcher's status on Discord. While this feature adds value by improving user engagement and providing real-time status updates, it is not critical to the core functionality of the launcher, which is to manage and launch modded Minecraft servers. Therefore, its importance is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of 'discord-rpc-patch' is limited to a single file (app/assets/js/discordwrapper.js) where it is used to initialize and manage Discord Rich Presence. The usage is straightforward and does not deeply intertwine with the core functionalities of the launcher. This makes the dependency relatively easy to remove or replace without significant impact on the overall project structure.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to 'discord-rpc-patch' for integrating Discord Rich Presence, such as 'discord-rpc' and 'discord.js'. These alternatives offer similar functionalities and could serve as suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacing 'discord-rpc-patch'.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The dependency is a patch of an existing library with removed native dependencies, and its functionality is not subject to frequent changes or deprecations. Additionally, the project's use of the dependency is not critical, reducing the urgency to act on its abandonment.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of the 'discord-rpc-patch' dependency to the Helios Launcher, its limited integration, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The feature it provides enhances user experience but is not essential to the launcher's core functionality.",

      "reasoning": "The fs-extra package is used extensively throughout the HeliosLauncher project for file system operations, including reading, writing, and managing files and directories. It is crucial for functionalities like asset management, configuration management, and mod handling. Given its widespread use and critical role in the project's operations, the functionality provided by fs-extra is highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "fs-extra is deeply integrated into the HeliosLauncher project, with its methods being called in multiple files and for various critical operations. This includes managing mods, handling configurations, and ensuring directories exist. The depth of its integration suggests that replacing it would require significant changes across the codebase.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to fs-extra, such as the native fs module with additional packages for missing functionalities, finding a drop-in replacement that offers the same convenience and additional features (like promise support and extra methods) is challenging. The availability of suitable alternatives is limited, making replacement difficult.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the stability and widespread use of fs-extra in the Node.js ecosystem, the likelihood of its abandonment forcing the project to act is relatively low. However, the possibility cannot be entirely ruled out, especially if critical security issues are discovered or if the maintainers decide to discontinue the project.",
      "score": 2

    "reasoning": "Considering the critical role of fs-extra in the HeliosLauncher project, its deep integration, the difficulty in finding suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of its abandonment, the abandonment of fs-extra would likely be directly impactful to the project. The project would face significant challenges in replacing fs-extra, affecting its functionality and development process.",
