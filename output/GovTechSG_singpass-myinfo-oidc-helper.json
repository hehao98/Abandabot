      "reasoning": "The lodash library is used extensively throughout the project for utility functions such as checking if a value is empty, mapping over arrays, and filtering. These functions are critical for the project's operation, especially in generating fake profiles and handling data. The widespread use of lodash indicates its importance in the project's functionality.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Lodash is integrated into many parts of the project, including profile generation, data handling, and utility functions. Its methods are used directly in various files, indicating a deep integration within the project's codebase. Replacing lodash would require significant refactoring of the code to either implement the utility functions manually or find another library that provides similar functionality.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to lodash, such as Ramda or native JavaScript methods, finding a library that provides the same level of utility and ease of use as lodash could be challenging. Additionally, the project's reliance on specific lodash methods means that any alternative would need to be carefully evaluated for compatibility and performance.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on lodash's abandonment is low. Lodash is a well-established library with a large community and is unlikely to be abandoned in the near future. However, if lodash were to be abandoned, the project would need to find a replacement or risk using an unsupported library.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the extensive use of lodash in the project for critical utility functions, its abandonment would likely be directly impactful. The project relies on lodash for data manipulation, profile generation, and other essential tasks. While the likelihood of lodash being abandoned is low, the impact would be significant, requiring a substantial effort to replace or reimplement its functionality.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The `proxy-agent` dependency is used to handle proxy configurations for HTTP requests in the project. Given the project's focus on integrating with Singpass and MyInfo APIs, which are critical for authentication and user data retrieval, the ability to manage proxies is important for ensuring reliable network communication. However, the direct impact on the core functionality of authentication and data retrieval is limited, as the primary functionality is provided by other dependencies like `axios` and `openid-client`.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The `proxy-agent` is integrated into the project through the `axios-client.ts` file, where it is used to create a custom proxy agent for Axios requests. This integration is relatively straightforward and limited to a specific part of the project's codebase, making it not deeply integrated. Replacing or removing this dependency would require adjustments in the Axios client configuration but would not necessitate extensive changes across the project.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available that provide similar proxy management functionalities, such as `http-proxy-agent`, `https-proxy-agent`, and `socks-proxy-agent`. These alternatives can serve as suitable replacements for `proxy-agent`, offering comparable features for handling proxy configurations. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace `proxy-agent` if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The `proxy-agent` dependency is used for managing proxy configurations, which is a stable and well-defined aspect of network communication. Changes in this area are infrequent, and the project could continue to function with existing proxy configurations even if the dependency were abandoned.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance, integration depth, availability of alternatives, and likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of the `proxy-agent` dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The dependency plays a supportive role in managing proxy configurations, which is important but not critical to the project's core functionality. Additionally, the availability of alternative packages and the low likelihood of external changes further reduce the potential impact.",

      "reasoning": "Jest is a critical tool for testing in the project, as evidenced by its extensive use across various test files and scripts. It is used for unit, integration, and external tests, indicating its importance in ensuring the reliability and correctness of the code. The project's package.json lists Jest as a devDependency, and the test scripts are configured to use Jest for running tests. This widespread use and integration into the project's development workflow underscore Jest's importance.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Jest is deeply integrated into the project's testing framework. It is used in multiple test files across different parts of the project, including utility functions, client interactions, and domain logic. The project has specific Jest configurations and setup files, indicating a tailored integration. Replacing Jest would require significant effort to rewrite test cases, adjust configurations, and possibly change the testing approach, given its deep integration.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternative testing frameworks available for JavaScript, such as Mocha, Jasmine, and Ava, each has its own set of features and integration requirements. Finding an alternative that matches Jest's feature set, ease of use, and integration depth would be challenging. Additionally, the project's specific configurations and customizations for Jest would need to be replicated or adapted for any alternative, adding to the difficulty of replacement.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Jest's abandonment is relatively low. Jest is a widely used and actively maintained testing framework with a large community and ecosystem. However, the risk cannot be entirely ruled out, as changes in the JavaScript ecosystem or Jest's maintenance status could impact the project. The project's reliance on Jest for testing makes it somewhat vulnerable to such changes.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given Jest's critical role in the project's testing strategy, its deep integration, and the challenges associated with finding and integrating a suitable alternative, the abandonment of Jest would likely be impactful to the project. The project would face significant challenges in maintaining its testing framework and ensuring the reliability of its code without Jest.",
