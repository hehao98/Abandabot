    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The eventemitter3 dependency is used extensively throughout the Open MCT project for event handling, which is a core functionality for managing and responding to various events within the application. Given its widespread use across different components and plugins, the functionality provided by eventemitter3 is crucial for the project's operation.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Eventemitter3 is deeply integrated into the Open MCT project, with its usage spanning across multiple components, plugins, and APIs. The dependency is not just used in a few isolated instances but is a fundamental part of the project's architecture, making its replacement a complex task that would require significant refactoring.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternative packages available for event handling in JavaScript, such as Node.js's built-in EventEmitter or other third-party libraries, finding a suitable replacement that matches the performance and API compatibility of eventemitter3 could be challenging. The project's reliance on specific features and the performance optimizations of eventemitter3 adds to the difficulty of replacing it.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is relatively low. Eventemitter3 is a stable and widely used library with a strong community and maintenance history. However, the risk cannot be entirely ruled out, especially if the library's maintenance decreases or critical issues are discovered.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role of eventemitter3 in the Open MCT project, its deep integration, and the challenges associated with finding a suitable replacement, the abandonment of this dependency would likely be directly impactful to the project. The project would face significant challenges in maintaining its current functionality and performance without eventemitter3.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/d3-axis package provides TypeScript definitions for the d3-axis package, which is used for creating axes in D3.js visualizations. Given that Open MCT is a visualization framework for mission control data, the ability to create and customize axes is crucial for displaying data accurately and effectively. Therefore, the functionality provided by @types/d3-axis is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/d3-axis package is a TypeScript definition package, which means it is used at compile time to provide type information for the d3-axis package. Its integration into the project is primarily through TypeScript's type checking and autocompletion features. While this integration is important for development, it does not deeply affect the runtime behavior of the application. Replacing it would mainly involve updating TypeScript definitions, which is a relatively straightforward process.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages that provide TypeScript definitions for D3.js, including @types/d3. These alternatives could serve as suitable replacements for @types/d3-axis, as they include definitions for the entire D3.js library, including the axis module. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace @types/d3-axis if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the abandonment of @types/d3-axis is low. TypeScript definition packages are generally stable and do not require frequent updates. Additionally, the existence of alternative packages means that the project could switch to another package if @types/d3-axis were to be abandoned.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the functionality provided by @types/d3-axis to the project, the relatively low difficulty of replacing it due to its shallow integration and the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @types/d3-axis would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The sass-loader is used to compile SCSS files into CSS, which is a fundamental part of styling in web applications. Given that Open MCT is a visualization framework, its appearance and user interface are crucial for user experience. Therefore, the functionality provided by sass-loader is highly important for the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The sass-loader is integrated into the webpack configuration of Open MCT, specifically in the .webpack/webpack.common.mjs file. It is part of the build process, indicating a deep integration. However, its role is limited to the build process and does not directly affect the runtime behavior of the application.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to sass-loader, such as postcss-loader with appropriate plugins, less-loader, or even directly using CSS without preprocessors. These alternatives can provide similar functionality, making it relatively easy to replace sass-loader if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The sass-loader is a well-established tool with a large user base, and its abandonment would likely be gradual, giving the project time to adapt. Additionally, the availability of alternatives reduces the urgency of such a change.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of sass-loader to the project's build process and the availability of alternatives, its abandonment would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could transition to an alternative with minimal disruption.",
