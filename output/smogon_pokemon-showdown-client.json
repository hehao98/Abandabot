    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @babel/preset-typescript dependency is crucial for the project as it allows the use of TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, which can significantly improve code quality and developer productivity. Given that the project includes TypeScript in its devDependencies and uses it for building and testing, the functionality provided by @babel/preset-typescript is highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration depth of @babel/preset-typescript in the project is moderate. It is used in the build process, as indicated by the presence of TypeScript in the devDependencies and the build scripts in package.json. However, without specific code snippets showing its usage, it's challenging to assess the full extent of its integration.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternatives to @babel/preset-typescript, such as using the TypeScript compiler directly (tsc) or other Babel presets that can handle TypeScript. However, switching to an alternative would require adjustments in the build process and potentially in the codebase, making the replacement somewhat difficult but not impossible.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. TypeScript is widely used and supported, and @babel/preset-typescript is a key part of the Babel ecosystem, which is also widely used. However, the JavaScript ecosystem is fast-moving, and changes in Babel or TypeScript could potentially impact the project.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @babel/preset-typescript for the project's build process and TypeScript usage, its abandonment would be impactful. However, the availability of alternatives and the moderate depth of integration suggest that the impact could be managed. The low likelihood of external changes forcing action on the dependency's abandonment further reduces the potential impact.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The google-auth-library is used for validating Google ID tokens, which is a specific and narrow functionality. Given the context of the Pok\u00e9mon Showdown Client, this functionality does not appear to be central to the core features of the project, which are primarily focused on the game client itself. Therefore, the importance of this dependency to the project is relatively low.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is used in a single file (lib/validate-token.js) for a specific task (validating Google ID tokens). This indicates a shallow integration within the project's codebase. Replacing or removing this dependency would likely require minimal changes to the project's code.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative libraries available for validating Google ID tokens, such as jsonwebtoken and passport-google-oauth20. These alternatives are well-maintained and could serve as suitable replacements, making it relatively easy to switch away from google-auth-library if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The functionality provided by google-auth-library is not subject to frequent changes in external environments, and the project's use of this dependency is not critical to its core operations.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the low importance of the functionality provided by google-auth-library to the Pok\u00e9mon Showdown Client, the shallow integration of the dependency within the project's codebase, the availability of suitable alternative packages, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The typescript-eslint dependency is used for linting TypeScript code in the project. Given that the project is a client for Pok\u00e9mon Showdown, which is a complex application, maintaining code quality and consistency is crucial. The dependency is used in multiple configuration files and scripts, indicating its importance in the development workflow. However, it is not directly involved in the runtime functionality of the application, which slightly reduces its criticality.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The typescript-eslint dependency is integrated into the project's linting and testing scripts, as seen in the package.json file. It is also used in several configuration files (eslint.config.mjs, eslint-ps-standard.mjs) to define rules and configurations for TypeScript linting. This indicates a moderate level of integration, as it is not deeply embedded in the core application code but is essential for the development process.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to typescript-eslint for linting TypeScript code, such as TSLint (though it is deprecated), ESLint with TypeScript plugins, and other linting tools. These alternatives can provide similar functionality, making it relatively easy to replace typescript-eslint if necessary. However, transitioning to a new tool would require updating configuration files and potentially adjusting linting rules, which involves some effort.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. TypeScript and ESLint are widely used and supported in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem, and typescript-eslint is a key project bridging these two. While abandonment is always a possibility, the active community and the dependency's importance in the ecosystem reduce the likelihood of it being abandoned without a suitable replacement or community support.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of typescript-eslint in maintaining code quality and consistency in the project, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of forced action due to external changes, the abandonment of typescript-eslint would be somewhat impactful but not critically so. The project could transition to an alternative linting tool with some effort, and the impact on the application's runtime functionality would be minimal.",
