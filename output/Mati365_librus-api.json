      "reasoning": "Cheerio is used for parsing HTML responses from the Librus/Synergia electronic diary server. It is essential for extracting and manipulating data from the HTML content, which is a core functionality of the librus-api project. Without Cheerio, the project would struggle to parse and interact with the HTML data effectively.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Cheerio is integrated into the project's codebase at multiple points, including the creation of querying functions and utility functions in lib/api.js. It is also used in lib/tools.js for making boolean values from titles. The depth of its integration suggests that replacing it would require significant changes to the codebase.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Cheerio, such as JSDOM and parse5, which also provide HTML parsing and manipulation capabilities. However, the ease of replacement depends on the specific features and API used by the project. Given Cheerio's jQuery-like API, finding a drop-in replacement might be challenging but not impossible.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Cheerio's abandonment is moderate. While Cheerio is widely used and maintained, the JavaScript ecosystem is fast-moving, and dependencies can become abandoned or deprecated. However, given Cheerio's popularity and active maintenance, the immediate risk seems low.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given Cheerio's critical role in parsing and manipulating HTML content within the librus-api project, its abandonment would likely be impactful. The project heavily relies on Cheerio for its core functionality, and while there are alternatives, the depth of integration and the specific API used by Cheerio would make replacement non-trivial. However, the current active maintenance and popularity of Cheerio mitigate the immediate risk of abandonment.",

      "reasoning": "Prettier is a code formatting tool that ensures consistent code style across the project. While it is useful for maintaining code quality and readability, it does not directly impact the core functionality of the librus-api project, which is to interact with the Librus/Synergia electronic diary system. The project's functionality would remain intact even without Prettier, although code readability and maintainability might suffer.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Prettier is integrated into the project as a development tool, primarily used through a script in the package.json file (`yarn prettier --write .`). It is not deeply integrated into the project's core codebase or its runtime functionality. Replacing or removing Prettier would not require significant changes to the project's codebase.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Prettier for code formatting, such as ESLint (with formatting rules), StandardJS, and Beautify. These alternatives can provide similar functionality in terms of code formatting and style enforcement. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace Prettier if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Prettier's abandonment is low. Prettier is a widely used and actively maintained project, and its abandonment would not directly affect the librus-api project's ability to function. However, if Prettier were to be abandoned, the project might need to switch to an alternative code formatting tool to maintain code quality.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Given that Prettier is a development tool used for code formatting and not directly tied to the core functionality of the librus-api project, its abandonment would not be directly impactful. The project could continue to function without Prettier, and there are several alternatives available for code formatting. Therefore, the abandonment of Prettier would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

      "reasoning": "The tough-cookie dependency is used for managing cookies in the librus-api project. Given that the project is a client for interacting with the Librus/Synergia electronic diary server, which likely requires session management and authentication, cookies are a crucial part of the functionality. The dependency is directly used in the project's constructor to create a CookieJar instance, indicating its importance in the project's core functionality.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of tough-cookie in the librus-api project is relatively straightforward. It is used to create a CookieJar instance in the project's constructor, which is a common pattern for managing cookies in HTTP clients. The dependency does not appear to be deeply integrated into the project's codebase beyond this usage, suggesting that replacing it would not be overly complex.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to tough-cookie for managing cookies in Node.js, such as cookie, cookies, and js-cookie. These alternatives provide similar functionality and could potentially serve as suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives suggests that replacing tough-cookie would not be overly difficult, provided that the replacement library is compatible with the project's requirements.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is relatively low. While the abandonment of a widely used dependency like tough-cookie could have broader implications, the project's specific usage of the dependency is limited to cookie management, which is a well-supported feature in Node.js. Additionally, the availability of alternative packages reduces the risk of being forced to act due to abandonment.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of cookie management in the librus-api project, the abandonment of the tough-cookie dependency could be impactful. However, the relatively shallow integration of the dependency and the availability of suitable alternatives mitigate this impact. Therefore, while the abandonment would be noteworthy, it is unlikely to be directly impactful to the project.",
