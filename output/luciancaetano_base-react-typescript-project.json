    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The `react-router-dom` package is crucial for routing in the project, as evidenced by its extensive usage across various components and pages. It is used for navigation, route definitions, and handling authenticated routes. Given its central role in the application's navigation and structure, its functionality is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "`react-router-dom` is deeply integrated into the project, with its usage spanning across multiple components, pages, and the application's routing logic. It is used in the main layout, various pages, and the application's provider. This deep integration makes it difficult to replace without significant refactoring.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to `react-router-dom` such as `wouter` or `reach-router`, they may not offer the same level of features or community support. Additionally, the project's current implementation and architecture are tightly coupled with `react-router-dom`, making the transition to an alternative challenging.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the stability and widespread adoption of `react-router-dom`, the likelihood of it being abandoned is low. However, if external environmental changes such as major React updates or shifts in community preferences occur, it could force the project to reconsider its routing solution.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of `react-router-dom` to the project's routing and navigation, its deep integration, the challenges in finding suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of `react-router-dom` would be highly impactful to the project.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @phosphor-icons/react dependency provides a comprehensive set of icons that can be used throughout the project. Given the project's focus on building a scalable and maintainable React application with TypeScript, having a consistent and easily customizable icon set is beneficial. However, the project does not heavily rely on icons for its core functionality, and the use of icons is more about enhancing the user interface rather than being a critical component of the application's logic.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @phosphor-icons/react in the project appears to be straightforward, with icons being imported and used in components as needed. The project's structure and the way components are organized suggest that replacing the dependency would not require extensive changes to the codebase. The use of TypeScript path aliases and the modular component structure would facilitate the replacement process.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative icon libraries available for React applications, such as react-icons, which includes a wide range of icon sets including Font Awesome, Material Design Icons, and more. These alternatives offer similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements for @phosphor-icons/react. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace the dependency without significant impact on the project.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The project is self-contained, and the use of icons is not tied to external services or APIs that could change or become unavailable. Additionally, the dependency is actively maintained, reducing the risk of sudden abandonment.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the dependency to the project, the ease of integration and replacement, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @phosphor-icons/react would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could transition to an alternative icon library with minimal disruption.",

  },
  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The `eslint-import-resolver-typescript` dependency is crucial for resolving TypeScript module imports in the project. Given that the project is a TypeScript-based React starter, the ability to correctly resolve TypeScript paths and imports is fundamental. The project's README emphasizes the use of TypeScript path aliases, which are directly supported by this dependency. Without it, the project would face significant issues in module resolution, potentially breaking the build and linting processes.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project's ESLint configuration, as seen in the package.json file. It is used to resolve TypeScript imports, which is a core functionality for the project's development and build processes. However, its integration is limited to the ESLint configuration, and it does not deeply intertwine with the project's core logic or components. This makes it somewhat replaceable, but not without effort, especially in configuring a new resolver that supports TypeScript path aliases.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative packages that can resolve TypeScript imports, such as `tsconfig-paths` or custom webpack configurations. However, these alternatives may not offer the same level of integration with ESLint or support for TypeScript path aliases out of the box. The availability of alternatives is moderate, but finding one that seamlessly integrates with the project's existing setup and provides the same functionality could be challenging.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. TypeScript and ESLint are widely used technologies with strong community support. However, if the dependency were to be abandoned, the project might need to find an alternative resolver to maintain its linting and module resolution capabilities. This scenario is not highly likely but is possible in the long term.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of `eslint-import-resolver-typescript` in resolving TypeScript imports and its integration into the project's ESLint configuration, its abandonment would be impactful. However, the availability of alternatives and the moderate difficulty of replacing it mitigate the overall impact. The project would need to find and configure a new resolver, but this is manageable with some effort.",
