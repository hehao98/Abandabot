    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency 'wicked-elements' is used in multiple components within the Rivet project, including fileInput, switch, alert, and the base component class. It provides essential functionality for initializing DOM elements with Web Component-like behavior, which is a core part of the project's component architecture. Given its widespread use and the critical role it plays in the component lifecycle, the functionality provided by 'wicked-elements' is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of 'wicked-elements' is deep within the Rivet project's codebase. It is used in the initialization of multiple components, indicating that it is tightly coupled with the project's component architecture. Replacing 'wicked-elements' would require significant refactoring of these components to adapt to a new library or custom implementation, making the replacement process difficult.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternative libraries that provide similar functionality to 'wicked-elements', such as 'lighterhtml' or 'augmentor', finding a suitable replacement that matches the specific use cases and integration patterns within the Rivet project could be challenging. The project would need to evaluate these alternatives carefully to ensure they meet the project's requirements, which adds to the difficulty of replacing 'wicked-elements'.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the project could continue to use 'wicked-elements' even if it were abandoned, as long as it meets the project's needs, changes in browser standards or security vulnerabilities could necessitate a replacement. However, given the current stability and widespread use of 'wicked-elements', this scenario is not highly likely in the near term.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of 'wicked-elements' to the Rivet project's component architecture, the depth of its integration, the challenges in finding and implementing a suitable alternative, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of 'wicked-elements' would likely be directly impactful to the project. The project would face significant challenges in maintaining and evolving its component architecture without 'wicked-elements', making it a critical dependency.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The 'standard' dependency is used for linting JavaScript code in the project. Linting is crucial for maintaining code quality and consistency, especially in a project like Rivet that aims to provide a design system for digital interfaces. The presence of 'standard' in the 'lint' script in package.json indicates its importance in the development workflow.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The 'standard' dependency is integrated into the project through the 'lint' script in package.json, which runs 'standard' on the 'src/js' directory. This indicates a moderate level of integration, as it is used for a specific task (linting) rather than being deeply embedded throughout the codebase.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to 'standard' for JavaScript linting, such as ESLint with various configurations, Prettier for code formatting, and other style guides like Airbnb's. These alternatives are widely used and could serve as suitable replacements, making the replacement of 'standard' relatively straightforward.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. 'standard' is a well-established tool with a large community, and its abandonment would likely be gradual, giving the project time to adapt. Additionally, the project could switch to an alternative linter without significant disruption.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of linting for code quality, the moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of the 'standard' dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could transition to an alternative linter with relatively low effort.",
    "impactful": false
  },
  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency 'sass' is crucial for the Rivet project as it is used extensively throughout the project's SCSS files. It is responsible for compiling SCSS into CSS, which is a core functionality for the project's design system. The project's README emphasizes the importance of CSS in building digital interfaces, indicating that 'sass' plays a significant role in the project's workflow.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Sass is deeply integrated into the Rivet project, as evidenced by its usage in numerous SCSS files across the project. It is used in the compilation process, as seen in the 'compile-sass.js' script, and is essential for the project's build process. The project's package.json lists 'sass' as a devDependency, further indicating its integration into the development workflow.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to Sass, such as Less or PostCSS, transitioning to another preprocessor would require significant effort. This includes rewriting SCSS files to be compatible with the new preprocessor and potentially adjusting the build process. The project's reliance on Sass-specific features, as seen in the SCSS files, adds to the complexity of finding a suitable replacement.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Sass's abandonment is moderate. While Sass is widely used and supported, the JavaScript ecosystem is known for its rapid changes. However, given Sass's established position and the project's current stability, immediate action due to external changes is less likely.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role of Sass in the Rivet project's build process and its deep integration into the project's SCSS files, the abandonment of Sass would likely be directly impactful. The project heavily relies on Sass for compiling SCSS into CSS, which is a core functionality of the design system. While there are alternatives, the effort required to transition to another preprocessor would be significant. Therefore, the abandonment of Sass would necessitate immediate attention and action from the project's maintainers.",
