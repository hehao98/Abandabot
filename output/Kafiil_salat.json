    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The chakra-react-select dependency is used in the SelectCity component, which is likely a crucial part of the user interface for selecting cities. Given that the project is focused on providing prayer times in Morocco, the ability to select a city is fundamental to its core functionality. Therefore, the functionality provided by chakra-react-select is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is directly imported and used in the SelectCity component. The integration appears to be straightforward, with no complex or deeply nested usage patterns observed in the provided code snippet. This suggests that replacing the dependency, while potentially requiring some refactoring, would not be excessively difficult.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available for React select components, such as react-select and downshift, which could potentially serve as suitable replacements. These alternatives offer similar functionality and are widely used in the React ecosystem, making it relatively easy to find a replacement for chakra-react-select.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The project's core functionality does not heavily rely on external services or APIs that could be affected by the abandonment of chakra-react-select. Additionally, the React ecosystem is stable, and major changes that would force action are unlikely.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the chakra-react-select dependency to the project's core functionality, its relatively straightforward integration, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of chakra-react-select would likely be impactful to the project. However, the impact could be mitigated by the availability of alternative packages and the dependency's shallow integration.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @testing-library/jest-dom package provides custom jest matchers to test the state of the DOM, which is crucial for ensuring the UI behaves as expected. However, the Salat project, as described in its README, focuses on displaying prayer times and Hijri dates, which are primarily data-driven and do not heavily rely on complex DOM manipulations or testing. Therefore, while jest-dom is useful, it is not critical to the core functionality of the Salat project.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @testing-library/jest-dom in the Salat project is minimal. It is only imported in the jest.setup.js file to extend jest's expect functionality with custom DOM matchers. There is no evidence of deep integration or extensive usage throughout the project's codebase. This suggests that replacing or removing jest-dom would not significantly impact the project's structure or functionality.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @testing-library/jest-dom for testing DOM elements and states, such as chai-dom, enzyme (with jest), and even vanilla jest with custom matchers. These alternatives can provide similar functionality, making it relatively easy to replace jest-dom if necessary. The availability of these alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacing jest-dom in the Salat project.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The @testing-library/jest-dom package is widely used and maintained by the testing-library community, which reduces the risk of abandonment. Additionally, the project's minimal reliance on jest-dom further decreases the impact of such an event.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the minimal importance and integration of @testing-library/jest-dom in the Salat project, along with the availability of alternatives and the low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of jest-dom would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could easily adapt by switching to an alternative testing solution without significant disruption.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The eslint-config-next package is used for linting in the project, which is crucial for maintaining code quality and consistency. However, the core functionality of the project, which is to provide prayer times in Morocco, does not directly depend on this package. Therefore, while important for development practices, it is not critical to the project's main features.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of eslint-config-next is limited to the development environment and does not deeply affect the core functionality of the project. It is used in the 'lint' script in package.json, indicating its use is primarily for code quality checks rather than being embedded in the application's logic or user-facing features.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to eslint-config-next, such as standard, airbnb, and other ESLint configurations. These alternatives can provide similar linting capabilities and could be adopted with some configuration changes. The availability of these alternatives makes replacing eslint-config-next feasible.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. Linting configurations are generally stable and changes in this area are less likely to be driven by external factors compared to core dependencies. The project could continue using the current configuration even if the package is abandoned, as long as it meets the project's needs.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, the abandonment of eslint-config-next would not likely be directly impactful to the project. Its role is important for maintaining code quality but is not critical to the project's core functionality. There are feasible alternatives available, and the integration depth is minimal. External factors are unlikely to force a change.",
