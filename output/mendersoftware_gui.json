      "reasoning": "The @mui/material dependency is extensively used across the project for UI components, including dialogs, buttons, forms, and navigation. Its functionality is crucial for the project's user interface and user experience. Given its widespread use, the dependency's abandonment would significantly impact the project's ability to maintain and develop its UI.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "@mui/material is deeply integrated into the project, with its components used in various parts of the application, from the main navigation to specific device management features. Replacing it would require a comprehensive overhaul of the UI components, which is a complex and time-consuming task.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternative UI component libraries available, such as Ant Design or Bootstrap, transitioning to another library would require significant effort to ensure compatibility and maintain the current level of functionality and design consistency. The availability of alternatives does not mitigate the difficulty of replacement.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the popularity and active maintenance of @mui/material, the likelihood of its abandonment in the near future is low. However, the project should still be prepared for such a scenario, especially considering the dependency's critical role in the application.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the critical role of @mui/material in the project's UI, its deep integration, and the significant effort required to replace it, the abandonment of this dependency would be highly impactful. Although the likelihood of abandonment is low, the project should monitor the dependency's status and consider contingency plans.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @babel/plugin-transform-runtime plugin is used to avoid duplication of Babel's helper code and to reduce the size of the generated code. While it is beneficial for optimizing the build process, the core functionality of the project does not directly depend on it. The project can still function without this plugin, albeit with potentially larger bundle sizes and some duplicated code.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The plugin is integrated into the project's Babel configuration, which is a standard part of the build process. However, its removal or replacement would not require extensive changes to the project's codebase. The integration is limited to the build configuration, making it relatively easy to replace or remove.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @babel/plugin-transform-runtime, including manually managing Babel helpers or using other Babel plugins that offer similar functionality. The availability of these alternatives makes it easier to replace the plugin if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. Babel is a widely used tool with a large community, and the plugin is part of the Babel ecosystem. The risk of abandonment is minimal, and even if it were to be abandoned, the impact on the project would be manageable.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the analysis, the abandonment of @babel/plugin-transform-runtime would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The plugin's role is more about optimization than providing essential functionality. The project can continue to operate without it, and there are alternatives available if needed. The integration is not deeply embedded in the codebase, making it easier to replace or remove.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The jest-resolve package is a core part of the Jest testing framework, which is used for resolving modules in the test environment. Given that the project uses Jest for testing, as indicated by the presence of jest and related packages in the package.json, jest-resolve plays a crucial role in ensuring that tests can run correctly by resolving dependencies. However, its functionality is specific to the testing environment and does not directly impact the production build or the core functionality of the Mender GUI.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "jest-resolve is integrated into the Jest testing framework, which is used for testing the project. The integration depth is moderate because it is essential for the test environment but does not affect the production code directly. Replacing jest-resolve would require changes to the Jest configuration or potentially switching to a different testing framework, which could be complex but is manageable given the modular nature of testing frameworks.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative testing frameworks and module resolution strategies available, such as Mocha with Chai or Jasmine, which could potentially replace Jest and, by extension, jest-resolve. However, switching to a different testing framework would require significant effort to rewrite tests and adjust the project's configuration. The availability of alternatives is high, but the effort to switch is also considerable.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the abandonment of jest-resolve is low. Jest is a widely used and actively maintained testing framework, and jest-resolve is a core part of it. The community and ecosystem around Jest are strong, reducing the risk of abandonment. However, if Jest were to be abandoned or significantly changed, it could impact jest-resolve.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of jest-resolve to the testing environment, the moderate depth of its integration, the availability of alternatives with significant switching effort, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of jest-resolve would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could continue to function in the short term without immediate changes, and there would be time to evaluate alternatives if necessary.",
