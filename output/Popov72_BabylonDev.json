    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Webpack is a critical tool for the project as it is used for bundling JavaScript files, which is essential for the project's build process. The project's package.json shows that webpack is used in both the development and build scripts, indicating its importance in the project's workflow.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Webpack is deeply integrated into the project's build and development process. It is used in the project's scripts for both development and production builds, and there are specific configurations in the .vscode/launch.json file that reference webpack. This indicates a high level of integration within the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to webpack, such as Parcel or Rollup, replacing webpack would require significant changes to the project's build and development process. The project's specific configurations and the use of webpack-specific features (like webpackIgnore in the glslang.ts file) would make the transition to an alternative bundler complex and time-consuming.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given webpack's widespread use and active maintenance, the likelihood of it being abandoned in the near future is low. However, if external environmental changes, such as a major shift in the JavaScript ecosystem or the emergence of a significantly better tool, were to occur, it could force the project to consider alternatives.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the critical role webpack plays in the project's build and development process, its deep integration, the complexity of replacing it, and the low likelihood of its abandonment, the abandonment of webpack would likely be directly impactful to the project.",
    "impactful": true
  },
  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency @types/jquery is a TypeScript definition package for jQuery. Given that the project is focused on BabylonJS, a 3D engine, and the package.json does not list jQuery as a direct dependency, it suggests that jQuery might not be central to the project's core functionality. However, if jQuery is used in the project for DOM manipulation or AJAX calls, its TypeScript definitions would be important for type checking and development. Without specific usage details, the importance is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Since @types/jquery is a TypeScript definition package, its integration depth depends on how extensively jQuery is used in the project. If jQuery is used across many files and components, replacing its TypeScript definitions could be somewhat challenging. However, given the lack of specific usage details, it's difficult to assess the exact depth of integration.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to jQuery for DOM manipulation and AJAX calls, such as Axios for AJAX and native JavaScript or other libraries for DOM manipulation. However, the availability of TypeScript definitions for these alternatives varies. If the project decides to move away from jQuery, finding suitable TypeScript definitions for alternatives could be a consideration.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. jQuery has been a stable library for many years, and its TypeScript definitions are maintained by the community. However, the JavaScript ecosystem is dynamic, and shifts in best practices or the emergence of new libraries could influence this.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the provided context, @types/jquery is moderately important for the project if jQuery is used. The integration depth is uncertain but likely not extensive. There are alternatives available, though their TypeScript support varies. The likelihood of external changes forcing action is low. Therefore, the abandonment of @types/jquery would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",
    "impactful": false

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The webpack-cli is used in the project's build and development scripts, which are essential for compiling and serving the project. Without it, the project would not be able to be built or run in a development environment. This makes the functionality provided by webpack-cli highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The webpack-cli is integrated into the project's npm scripts for both development and production builds. This indicates a moderate level of integration, as it is used in predefined scripts rather than being deeply embedded in the project's codebase.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to webpack-cli, such as Parcel, Rollup, and Browserify, which can also handle module bundling. However, switching to an alternative would require some effort to reconfigure the build process and potentially adjust the project's codebase.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the widespread use of webpack in the JavaScript ecosystem and the active maintenance of webpack-cli, the likelihood of it being abandoned in the near future is low. However, the JavaScript ecosystem is known for rapid changes, so this cannot be completely ruled out.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of webpack-cli to the project's build and development process, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of webpack-cli would be impactful but not critically so. The project could transition to an alternative with some effort.",
