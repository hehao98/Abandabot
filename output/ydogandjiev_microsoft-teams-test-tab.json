    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @microsoft/teams-js dependency is crucial for the project as it provides the necessary SDK for integrating with Microsoft Teams. The project is specifically designed to test and demonstrate various functionalities within Microsoft Teams, making this dependency essential for its core operations. The extensive usage of the SDK across the codebase, including app initialization, navigation, authentication, and various Teams-specific functionalities, underscores its importance.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is deeply integrated into the project's codebase, with numerous calls to its API across different modules and functionalities. The project relies on the SDK for a wide range of operations, from basic app initialization to complex interactions with Teams' features. This deep integration makes replacing the dependency a significant challenge, as it would require extensive code refactoring and testing.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "Given the specific nature of the @microsoft/teams-js SDK, which is tailored for Microsoft Teams integration, finding a suitable alternative that provides the same level of functionality and compatibility is difficult. While there may be other SDKs or libraries for integrating with Microsoft Teams, they may not offer the same comprehensive set of features or may require substantial changes to the project's architecture and code.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. Microsoft Teams is a widely used platform, and Microsoft is likely to continue supporting its SDK. However, changes in Microsoft's strategy or the Teams platform could potentially impact the SDK's availability or compatibility, necessitating action from the project.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the critical role of the @microsoft/teams-js SDK in the project, its deep integration, the lack of direct alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of this dependency would be highly impactful to the project. It would require significant effort to replace or adapt to the loss of this dependency, affecting the project's functionality and maintainability.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "TypeScript is a devDependency in the project, used for compiling TypeScript code into JavaScript. Given that the project's main functionality is implemented in JavaScript and TypeScript is used for development purposes, its importance to the core functionality of the project is moderate. However, it plays a crucial role in the development process, especially for type checking and modern JavaScript features.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "TypeScript is integrated into the project through the use of ts-loader in the webpack configuration. This indicates a moderate level of integration, as the project relies on TypeScript for compiling code during the build process. However, the core functionality of the project does not directly depend on TypeScript, making it replaceable with some effort.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to TypeScript, such as Babel for compiling modern JavaScript, or even sticking to plain JavaScript. However, TypeScript offers unique features like static type checking, which can be beneficial for large projects. While alternatives exist, they may not provide the exact same benefits, making the replacement somewhat challenging but not impossible.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on TypeScript's abandonment is low. TypeScript is widely used and supported by a large community, making it unlikely to be abandoned in the near future. Additionally, the project could switch to alternatives if necessary, without significant impact on its core functionality.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, TypeScript's abandonment would have a moderate impact on the project. While it is important for the development process, the core functionality of the project does not directly depend on it. There are also viable alternatives available, and the likelihood of TypeScript being abandoned is low. Therefore, while the abandonment would be noteworthy, it would not be directly impactful to the project.",

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The ts-loader is crucial for the project as it is responsible for compiling TypeScript files into JavaScript, which is essential for the project to run. The project's build and watch scripts rely on webpack, which in turn uses ts-loader to handle TypeScript files. Without ts-loader, the project cannot be built or run in its current state.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "ts-loader is integrated into the project through the webpack configuration file (webpack.config.js). It is used in the module rules to process TypeScript files. While the integration is straightforward and limited to the webpack configuration, replacing it would require modifying the webpack configuration and potentially other parts of the build process.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to ts-loader for compiling TypeScript in webpack, such as babel-loader with @babel/preset-typescript or awesome-typescript-loader. These alternatives can provide similar functionality, and switching to one of them would not be overly complex, though it would require some adjustments to the webpack configuration and possibly the TypeScript configuration.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on ts-loader's abandonment is low. TypeScript and webpack are both widely used and well-supported, and ts-loader is a popular choice for integrating TypeScript with webpack. However, if ts-loader were to be abandoned, the project would need to find an alternative to continue building and running.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the importance of ts-loader to the project's build process and its straightforward integration, the abandonment of ts-loader would be impactful. However, the availability of alternatives and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action mitigate the impact. Overall, the abandonment of ts-loader would be impactful but manageable.",
