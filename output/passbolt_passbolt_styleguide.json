    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @babel/runtime dependency is crucial for the project as it is used in the development environment to support the transformation of modern JavaScript features into a compatible version for older browsers. This is essential for ensuring that the project's codebase is accessible and functional across a wide range of environments. Given its role in the build process and its direct impact on the project's compatibility and performance, the functionality provided by @babel/runtime is highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "@babel/runtime is integrated into the project through the Babel configuration and is used in conjunction with other Babel plugins and presets. Its integration is deep, as it is part of the build process that transforms the project's code. Replacing it would require significant changes to the build configuration and potentially the codebase itself to ensure compatibility with a different runtime or transformation tool.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to @babel/runtime, such as directly including polyfills or using different transformation tools, these alternatives may not provide the same level of convenience, performance, or compatibility. The ecosystem around Babel is extensive, and finding a replacement that seamlessly integrates with the existing setup and offers similar benefits is challenging.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While Babel is a widely used tool with a large community, the JavaScript ecosystem is fast-evolving, and shifts in standards or the emergence of new tools could potentially reduce the necessity for Babel. However, given Babel's current importance and widespread use, such a scenario is not imminent.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @babel/runtime to the project's build process and compatibility, the depth of its integration, the challenges in finding suitable alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of external changes necessitating action, the abandonment of @babel/runtime would likely be impactful to the project. It plays a critical role in ensuring the project's code is accessible and functional across different environments, and replacing it would require significant effort.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The memoize-one dependency is used in multiple components within the project to optimize performance by caching the results of functions. This is particularly important in components that handle filtering and searching of resources, which are likely to be frequent operations in a password manager application. The use of memoization helps in reducing unnecessary computations and improving the responsiveness of the application.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "memoize-one is integrated into various components across the project, particularly in components that deal with filtering and searching resources. It is used to wrap functions that perform these operations, indicating a moderate level of integration. However, the dependency is not deeply embedded into the core logic of the application but rather used as a utility to enhance performance.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to memoize-one, such as lodash.memoize, memoizee, and fast-memoize, which offer similar functionality. These alternatives are well-maintained and could potentially serve as suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace memoize-one if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. memoize-one is a stable and widely used library with a clear purpose. Changes in the JavaScript ecosystem or in the project's requirements that would necessitate a replacement of memoize-one are unlikely in the near future.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of memoize-one in optimizing performance across various components, its moderate level of integration, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes necessitating its replacement, the abandonment of memoize-one would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could transition to an alternative library with relative ease if needed.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @babel/preset-react is used in the project's ESLint configuration to parse and lint React code. Given that the project is a styleguide for a React-based application (Passbolt), the ability to properly lint React code is crucial for maintaining code quality and consistency. However, the direct impact of @babel/preset-react on the project's core functionality is limited, as it is primarily a development tool rather than a runtime dependency.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @babel/preset-react in the project is minimal, as it is only specified in the ESLint configuration file (.eslintrc.json). This indicates that its role is confined to the linting process and does not deeply integrate with the project's build or runtime processes. Replacing or removing it would primarily affect the linting setup, which, while important, is not deeply embedded in the project's core functionality.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @babel/preset-react for linting React code, such as eslint-plugin-react or directly using Babel's configuration without a preset. These alternatives can provide similar functionality with minimal changes to the project's configuration. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace @babel/preset-react if necessary.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the abandonment of @babel/preset-react is low. The dependency is used for linting purposes, and changes in the React ecosystem or Babel are unlikely to directly impact the project's ability to lint React code. Additionally, the project could switch to an alternative linting solution if needed.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, the abandonment of @babel/preset-react would have a limited impact on the Passbolt styleguide project. Its role is confined to the linting process, and there are viable alternatives available. The project's core functionality and build processes are not deeply dependent on this package, making its abandonment unlikely to be directly impactful.",
