    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The lux-design-system is used in multiple components and test files within the project, indicating its integration into the core functionality of the application. It is imported and used in the main application loader (pulfalight_loader.es6), suggesting it plays a significant role in the application's UI and possibly its overall design and user experience. Given its usage across different parts of the project, the functionality provided by lux-design-system is important for maintaining the application's current state and user interface.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project through direct imports in several key components and the main application loader. It is used for UI components and styling, which are fundamental to the application's appearance and user interaction. The depth of integration is significant, as changing or replacing this dependency would require updates to multiple files and potentially affect the application's UI/UX.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are other design systems and UI component libraries available, finding one that matches the specific needs and design language of the project could be challenging. The lux-design-system is tailored for the project's requirements, and switching to an alternative would require significant effort in terms of component replacement, styling adjustments, and testing to ensure compatibility and maintain the current user experience.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the project could continue to use an abandoned version of the dependency for some time, security vulnerabilities, compatibility issues with newer technologies, or the need for new features could eventually necessitate a change. However, given the project's current stability and the dependency's specific use case, immediate action might not be required.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the lux-design-system to the project's UI and user experience, the depth of its integration, the challenges in finding suitable alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would be impactful. It would require significant effort to replace and could affect the application's functionality and user experience.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The postcss-import plugin is used to transform `@import` rules by inlining content, which is a common requirement in CSS preprocessing. Given that the project uses PostCSS for CSS processing, postcss-import plays a crucial role in managing and optimizing CSS files. Its functionality is directly tied to the project's ability to efficiently handle CSS, making it highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of postcss-import within the project appears to be straightforward, primarily used in the CSS preprocessing pipeline. The project's package.json lists postcss-import as a dependency, indicating its use in the build process. However, there is no evidence of deep, complex integration within the project's codebase, suggesting that replacing it, while inconvenient, would not be overly difficult.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to postcss-import, such as postcss-easy-import and postcss-partial-import, which offer similar functionality. The availability of these alternatives suggests that replacing postcss-import would not be overly challenging, provided that the project's specific requirements can be met by one of these alternatives.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. PostCSS and its ecosystem are widely used and supported, making it unlikely that postcss-import would be abandoned without a suitable replacement or alternative solution being available.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of postcss-import to the project's CSS processing, its relatively straightforward integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of postcss-import would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could transition to an alternative with moderate effort.",

      "reasoning": "jQuery is used extensively throughout the project, particularly in the jstree.js file, which is a critical component for the project's functionality. The dependency is deeply integrated into the project's codebase, indicating its importance for the project's operation.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "jQuery is deeply integrated into the project, as evidenced by its usage in multiple files and its role in the jstree.js file, which is a significant part of the project's functionality. Replacing jQuery would require extensive code changes and testing.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to jQuery, such as vanilla JavaScript or other libraries like Axios for AJAX requests, the project's deep integration with jQuery and the specific functionalities it uses (e.g., DOM manipulation, event handling) make finding a suitable replacement challenging.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given jQuery's widespread use and the fact that it is still actively maintained, the likelihood of it being abandoned in the near future is low. However, the trend towards modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries could eventually reduce its relevance.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the deep integration of jQuery into the project, its importance for the project's functionality, and the challenges in finding a suitable replacement, the abandonment of jQuery would likely be impactful to the project. However, the current low likelihood of jQuery being abandoned mitigates the immediate risk.",
