  "dep1_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Jotai is used in multiple components and stores within the project, managing state for various aspects such as texture information, WebGL memory info, and stats. This indicates that Jotai plays a crucial role in the state management of the project, making its functionality highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Jotai is deeply integrated into the project, with atoms and hooks used across different components and stores. The project relies on Jotai for state management in several key areas, indicating a high level of integration.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are other state management libraries available for React (e.g., Redux, Recoil), Jotai's minimalistic approach and specific features (like derived atoms and async atoms) might make it more suitable for this project's needs. However, the availability of alternatives suggests that replacement is feasible, albeit potentially requiring significant refactoring.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the active development and community support for Jotai, as indicated by its GitHub activity and npm downloads, the likelihood of it being abandoned in the near future is low. However, external factors such as shifts in the React ecosystem or the emergence of new state management paradigms could influence this.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of Jotai to the project's state management, its deep integration, and the availability of alternatives, the abandonment of Jotai would likely be impactful. However, the current low likelihood of abandonment mitigates this impact.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The gltf-validator dependency is used to validate glTF files, which are crucial for the three-vrm-inspector project as it deals with VRM models that are based on the glTF format. The validation ensures the integrity and correctness of the models being inspected, making it an important part of the project's functionality.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project through a specific plugin (InspectorGLTFValidatorPlugin.ts) where it is used to validate the buffer of the model. The integration is not deeply woven into the core functionality but is a significant part of the inspection process.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative packages and tools for validating glTF files, such as the official glTF Validator from KhronosGroup. However, the gltf-validator npm package provides a convenient and direct way to integrate validation into the project's workflow, making it somewhat difficult to replace with alternatives that may require more setup or integration effort.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given that glTF is a widely adopted format for 3D models and VRM, it is unlikely that external environmental changes will force the project to act on the dependency's abandonment. The glTF format is stable and supported by a broad community, reducing the likelihood of such a scenario.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of glTF validation to the project's functionality, the moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of the gltf-validator dependency would be somewhat impactful but not critically so. The project could potentially switch to an alternative validation tool with some effort.",
    "impactful": false
  },
  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin is used for linting TypeScript code in the project. While linting is important for maintaining code quality, it is not directly related to the core functionality of the project, which is a VRM inspector for Three.js. Therefore, the functionality provided by this dependency is of moderate importance to the project.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project through the ESLint configuration, which is used in the 'lint' and 'lint-fix' scripts in the package.json. The integration is not deeply embedded in the project's core codebase but is rather part of the development toolchain. Replacing it would require updating the ESLint configuration and potentially the linting scripts, which is a manageable task.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives available for linting TypeScript code, such as TSLint (though it is deprecated), ESLint with other TypeScript plugins, or even custom linting solutions. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The TypeScript ecosystem is stable, and ESLint is widely used and maintained. However, if the plugin were to be abandoned, it could eventually lead to compatibility issues with newer versions of TypeScript or ESLint.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of the dependency's functionality, the manageable level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",
