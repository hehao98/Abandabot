    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @babel/preset-env dependency is crucial for the project as it handles the transpilation of ES6 code to earlier versions, ensuring compatibility with older browsers. This functionality is essential for the project's build process, as highlighted in the project's README. Without it, the project would not be able to maintain compatibility with a wide range of browsers, which is a key requirement for educational tools like h5p-cornell.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @babel/preset-env in the project is deep, as it is directly referenced in the .babelrc configuration file, which is essential for the build process. The project relies on this configuration to transpile and minify the code, indicating a high level of integration. Replacing this dependency would require significant changes to the build configuration and potentially the codebase itself.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to @babel/preset-env for transpiling JavaScript, such as TypeScript or other Babel presets, finding a direct replacement that offers the same level of browser compatibility and ease of use might be challenging. The project's specific needs, including the requirement to support older browsers, make @babel/preset-env a highly specialized tool.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the JavaScript ecosystem evolves rapidly, the core functionality provided by @babel/preset-env (transpiling for compatibility) remains relevant. However, changes in browser standards or the emergence of new transpilation tools could increase this likelihood.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role of @babel/preset-env in ensuring browser compatibility, its deep integration into the project's build process, and the challenges in finding a suitable alternative, the abandonment of this dependency would likely be directly impactful to the project. The project relies on this tool to maintain its functionality across a wide range of browsers, which is essential for its educational purpose.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The project uses Sass for styling, which is a common practice in web development to enhance CSS with features like variables, nesting, and mixins. Given that the project's build process includes transpiling and minifying CSS, Sass plays a crucial role in the development workflow. However, the project's core functionality (structured note-taking) does not directly depend on Sass, making it important but not critical.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Sass is integrated into the project through the build process, specifically via webpack and sass-loader. This integration is relatively straightforward and does not deeply intertwine with the project's core logic. Replacing Sass would primarily involve updating the build configuration and possibly refactoring the SCSS files, which is manageable.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Sass, such as LESS, PostCSS, and Stylus, which offer similar functionalities. These alternatives are well-maintained and widely used in the community, making it feasible to switch if necessary. The availability of alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacing Sass.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Sass's abandonment is low. Sass is a mature and widely adopted tool with a large community and ecosystem. While any software can become abandoned, the current state of Sass suggests it is unlikely in the near future.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of Sass in the project's development workflow, its manageable level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of Sass would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could transition to an alternative CSS preprocessor with moderate effort.",

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The project uses stylelint as part of its linting process, which is crucial for maintaining code quality and consistency. However, the primary functionality of the project, which is to allow students to take structured notes, does not directly depend on stylelint. Therefore, while stylelint is important for development, it is not critical to the core functionality of the project.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "stylelint is integrated into the project's build process through the 'lint' script in package.json. It is used to lint SCSS files, but the project does not heavily rely on stylelint for its core functionality. The integration is straightforward and could be replaced or removed without significant impact on the project's main features.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to stylelint for linting CSS and SCSS, such as ESLint (with appropriate plugins), CSSLint, and others. These alternatives could provide similar functionality, making it relatively easy to replace stylelint if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on stylelint's abandonment is low. stylelint is a well-established tool with a large community and is unlikely to be abandoned suddenly. Even if it were, the impact on the project would be minimal due to the availability of alternatives and the non-critical nature of stylelint to the project's core functionality.",
      "score": 1

    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, stylelint's abandonment would not likely be directly impactful to the project. It plays a role in maintaining code quality but is not essential for the core functionality of allowing students to take structured notes. The project could continue to function effectively even if stylelint were abandoned, especially given the availability of alternative linting tools.",
