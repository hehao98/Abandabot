    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Webpack is a core dependency for the Freighter project, used extensively across multiple workspaces for building and bundling the application. It is essential for the development and production builds, as indicated by its presence in various webpack configuration files. The project relies on Webpack for module bundling, code splitting, and other optimizations, making it a critical component of the build process.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Webpack is deeply integrated into the Freighter project, with multiple configuration files (webpack.dev.js, webpack.common.js, webpack.extension.js, etc.) across different workspaces. It is used for defining plugins, loaders, and other build settings. The project's build and start scripts heavily depend on Webpack, indicating a high level of integration. Replacing Webpack would require significant changes to the build process and configuration files.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternative module bundlers like Rollup, Parcel, and Browserify, Webpack's extensive plugin ecosystem and flexibility make it a preferred choice for complex projects like Freighter. The project's specific use of Webpack plugins and configurations would require careful consideration and potential rework to switch to an alternative. The availability of alternatives does not guarantee a seamless transition, given the project's current setup.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Webpack is a widely used and actively maintained project with a large community and corporate backing. The likelihood of it being abandoned in the near future is low. However, the JavaScript ecosystem is dynamic, and changes in the environment or the emergence of a superior tool could potentially force a reevaluation of the dependency.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given Webpack's critical role in the Freighter project's build process, its deep integration, and the complexity of replacing it, the abandonment of Webpack would be highly impactful. The project would face significant challenges in transitioning to an alternative module bundler, requiring extensive changes to the build configuration and potentially affecting the development workflow.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The babel-loader is used in the project to transpile JavaScript files, specifically for the webextension-polyfill. This functionality is crucial for ensuring compatibility across different browsers, especially for a browser extension like Freighter. Given the project's nature as a non-custodial wallet extension that needs to run seamlessly across various browsers, the role of babel-loader in the build process is significant.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The babel-loader is integrated into the project's webpack configuration, specifically targeting the webextension-polyfill. This indicates a focused use case rather than a widespread integration across the entire codebase. However, given that the webextension-polyfill is essential for cross-browser compatibility, the integration, while not extensive, is critical for the project's core functionality.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to babel-loader for JavaScript transpilation, such as ts-loader (for TypeScript) or esbuild-loader. However, the specific use case of transpiling the webextension-polyfill might require a loader that is well-supported and widely used in the community, like babel-loader. While alternatives exist, finding one that matches babel-loader's compatibility and community support for this specific use case could be challenging.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on babel-loader's abandonment is moderate. Changes in web standards or browser APIs could necessitate updates to the webextension-polyfill or its transpilation process. However, given the stability of the webpack ecosystem and the specific use case of babel-loader in this project, such changes are not highly likely in the short term.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of babel-loader for transpiling the webextension-polyfill, which is crucial for cross-browser compatibility, its abandonment could be impactful. However, the focused integration and the availability of alternatives mitigate the potential impact. The likelihood of external changes forcing action is also moderate. Overall, while the abandonment of babel-loader would be noteworthy, it is not highly likely to be directly impactful to the project in the immediate future.",

      "reasoning": "The @types/react-dom package provides TypeScript definitions for React DOM, which is crucial for ensuring type safety and developer experience in projects using React with TypeScript. Given that Freighter is a complex project involving a browser extension, SDK, and documentation, maintaining type safety across these components is essential. The dependency on @types/react-dom suggests that the project leverages TypeScript for development, making this package important for the project's development workflow and code quality.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration depth of @types/react-dom in the project is moderate. It is a development dependency that supports TypeScript development by providing type definitions for React DOM. While it is not directly involved in the runtime functionality of the application, its presence is crucial during the development phase for type checking and autocompletion. Replacing it would require ensuring that any alternative also provides comprehensive and accurate type definitions for React DOM, which could be challenging but not insurmountable.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are limited alternatives to @types/react-dom because it is the official TypeScript definitions package for React DOM. While it might be possible to use other type definition sources or to manually define types, these alternatives would likely be less comprehensive and more error-prone. The uniqueness and official nature of @types/react-dom make it difficult to replace with an equally suitable alternative.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. @types/react-dom is closely tied to React DOM, and as long as React DOM is actively maintained, @types/react-dom is likely to be as well. However, if React DOM were to be abandoned or significantly changed, it could impact the relevance and necessity of @types/react-dom.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @types/react-dom for ensuring type safety in a TypeScript project, its moderate integration depth, the lack of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @types/react-dom would be impactful to the Freighter project. It would affect the development workflow and potentially the code quality, making it a noteworthy event for the project's maintainers.",
