    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "@babel/core is a critical tool in the JavaScript ecosystem, especially for projects that use modern JavaScript features or TypeScript. It is used for transpiling code, which is essential for ensuring compatibility across different environments. Given that Prytaneum is a project that likely uses modern JavaScript or TypeScript (as indicated by the presence of TypeScript in the devDependencies), @babel/core plays a crucial role in the build process. Its functionality is foundational for the project's development and deployment workflows.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @babel/core in Prytaneum appears to be deep, as it is listed as a peer dependency for multiple tools within the project's .yarnrc.yml file. This suggests that @babel/core is not just a direct dependency but is also required by other tools used in the project. Replacing it would require not only removing @babel/core itself but also ensuring that all tools that depend on it are either updated to work without it or are replaced with alternatives that do not require @babel/core. This level of integration makes it difficult to replace.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to @babel/core, such as TypeScript's own transpiler or other build tools like esbuild, these alternatives may not offer the same level of compatibility or feature set. @babel/core has a wide range of plugins and presets that cater to various needs, making it a versatile choice for many projects. Finding an alternative that matches this versatility and is compatible with all the tools currently using @babel/core in Prytaneum could be challenging.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on @babel/core's abandonment is moderate. While @babel/core is widely used and supported, the JavaScript ecosystem is fast-moving, and shifts in standards or the emergence of more efficient tools could reduce its necessity. However, given its current widespread use and the project's reliance on it, such changes are not imminent but are possible in the long term.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @babel/core to the project's build process, its deep integration with other tools, the challenges in finding suitable alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @babel/core would likely be impactful to Prytaneum. The project would need to invest significant effort to replace it and adapt its build process, making it a noteworthy event.",

      "reasoning": "The @commitlint/prompt-cli dependency is used for enforcing commit message conventions in the project. While this is a good practice for maintaining a clean and consistent commit history, it is not critical to the core functionality of the project. The project could still function without it, albeit with potentially less organized commit messages. Therefore, the importance of this dependency to the project is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @commitlint/prompt-cli in the project appears to be minimal. It is listed in the devDependencies and is likely used in a pre-commit hook or similar setup. There is no evidence of deep integration within the project's codebase, suggesting that removing or replacing it would not be overly complex.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @commitlint/prompt-cli that provide similar functionality for enforcing commit message conventions, such as commitizen and standard-version. These alternatives are well-maintained and could serve as suitable replacements, making the replacement process relatively straightforward.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The dependency is related to commit message conventions, which are not typically subject to rapid changes in the external environment. Additionally, the project could continue to function without this dependency, albeit with less structured commit messages.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of @commitlint/prompt-cli to the project, its minimal integration, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

Given that the project is a GraphQL-based application, the functionality provided by this dependency is essential for ensuring type safety and developer productivity.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project's build process, as indicated by the 'g:codegen' script in the package.json file. This suggests that the dependency is used during the development phase to generate necessary TypeScript types. However, the integration does not appear to be deeply embedded in the runtime code, making it relatively easier to replace if needed.",

      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives available for generating TypeScript types from GraphQL schemas, such as 'graphql-code-generator' with different plugins or even custom scripts.

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The GraphQL ecosystem is stable, and there are no immediate signs of significant changes that would necessitate a switch from @graphql-codegen/typescript-resolvers. However, the open-source nature of the package means that abandonment is always a possibility, though not highly likely in the near term.",

    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the functionality provided by @graphql-codegen/typescript-resolvers to the project's GraphQL API development, its integration into the build process, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would be impactful but not critically so. The project could manage with alternative solutions, though it would require some effort to transition.",
