    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The Select2 dependency is used in multiple parts of the project, including admin interfaces and rule management, to enhance select boxes with search, remote data sets, and pagination. This functionality is crucial for user interaction and data management within the plugin, making it highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Select2 is integrated into various components of the project, including admin pages, visibility modules, and rule management. It is used in both PHP and TypeScript files, indicating a deep integration. Replacing it would require significant changes across the codebase.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Select2, such as Choices.js, SlimSelect, and Tom Select, which offer similar functionalities. However, the ease of replacement depends on the specific features used and the extent of integration. Given the project's reliance on Select2's specific features, finding a suitable replacement could be challenging.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Select2 is a widely used library with a large community and active maintenance. The likelihood of it being abandoned in the near future is low. However, external factors such as changes in web standards or the emergence of more efficient libraries could influence this.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the importance of Select2 to the project's functionality and its deep integration, its abandonment would be impactful. However, the likelihood of abandonment is low, and there are alternatives available, albeit with potential challenges in replacement.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Prettier is used as a code formatter in the project, ensuring consistent code style across the codebase. While it is important for maintaining code quality, it does not directly affect the core functionality of the WordPress plugin for SkautIS integration. Therefore, its importance is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Prettier is integrated into the project's development workflow, particularly in the linting process. It is used in conjunction with ESLint and other linting tools. However, it is not deeply embedded in the core functionality of the plugin, making its replacement relatively straightforward.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Prettier, such as ESLint's formatting capabilities, StandardJS, and Beautify. These alternatives can provide similar code formatting functionality, making it relatively easy to replace Prettier if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Prettier's abandonment is low. Prettier is widely used and maintained, and its abandonment would likely be gradual, giving the project ample time to adapt.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of Prettier in maintaining code quality, its relatively shallow integration in the project, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of Prettier would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The npm-run-all package is used to run multiple npm scripts in parallel or sequential. In the provided package.json, it is used in the 'lint:css', 'lint:php', 'lint:ts', and 'lint' scripts to aggregate the output of various linting tasks. This functionality is important for ensuring code quality and consistency across the project. However, the direct impact on the core functionality of the WordPress plugin (SkautIS integration) is minimal, as it is primarily a development tool.",
      "score": 3

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The npm-run-all package is integrated into the project's npm scripts, specifically for linting tasks. While it is used in multiple scripts, its integration is not deeply embedded into the core functionality of the project. Replacing it would require updating the npm scripts where it is used, but this would not require significant changes to the project's codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to npm-run-all, such as concurrently, parallelshell, and npm-run-all2, which can also run multiple npm scripts in parallel or sequential. These alternatives provide similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements with minimal changes to the project's npm scripts.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The npm-run-all package is a development tool, and its abandonment would not directly affect the production environment or the core functionality of the WordPress plugin. The project could continue to use the current version of npm-run-all even if it were abandoned, as long as it meets the project's needs.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance, integration, alternatives, and likelihood of external environmental changes, the abandonment of npm-run-all would not likely be directly impactful to the project. It is a development tool with minimal impact on the core functionality, and there are suitable alternatives available. The project could continue to use the current version or switch to an alternative with minimal effort.",
