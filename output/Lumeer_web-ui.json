    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @fullcalendar/timegrid dependency is used in the calendar visualization component of the Lumeer Web UI project. It is part of the calendar plugins that are essential for rendering the calendar view, which is a core feature of the application. The functionality provided by this dependency is crucial for displaying time-based events in a grid format, which is a significant aspect of the project's calendar feature.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @fullcalendar/timegrid dependency is integrated into the project as one of the calendar plugins used in the calendar visualization component. It is listed among other FullCalendar plugins, indicating that it is part of a broader set of functionalities required for the calendar feature. However, its integration seems to be modular, as it is used alongside other plugins, suggesting that replacing it might not require extensive changes to the codebase.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative calendar libraries available that could potentially replace @fullcalendar/timegrid, such as BigCalendar, React Big Calendar, or even custom solutions. These alternatives offer similar functionalities for displaying time-based events in a grid format. The availability of these alternatives suggests that finding a suitable replacement would not be overly difficult, although some adjustments and testing would be necessary to ensure compatibility and maintain the same level of functionality.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the FullCalendar library is widely used and maintained, the JavaScript ecosystem is known for its rapid changes and the potential for libraries to become abandoned. However, given the popularity and active community around FullCalendar, the risk of sudden abandonment without any alternatives or forks is relatively low.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the @fullcalendar/timegrid dependency to the project's calendar feature, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternative packages, and the relatively low likelihood of forced action due to external changes, the abandonment of this dependency would likely be impactful but not critically so. The project could transition to an alternative with some effort, but the functionality provided by this dependency is crucial for the calendar feature.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/node package provides TypeScript definitions for Node.js, which are crucial for TypeScript projects that interact with Node.js APIs. Given that Lumeer/web-ui is a front-end project, the direct usage of Node.js APIs might be limited. However, the presence of @types/node in the devDependencies suggests it's used during development, possibly for tooling or testing. Its importance is moderate because while it supports development, the core functionality of the project does not directly depend on Node.js APIs.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration depth of @types/node in the project appears to be low. It is listed in the devDependencies, indicating its use is confined to development and build processes rather than being deeply integrated into the application's runtime code. Replacing or removing it would likely affect development tooling but not the application's core functionality.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are no direct alternatives to @types/node for providing TypeScript definitions for Node.js. However, if the project's reliance on Node.js APIs is minimal or can be abstracted away, the need for these definitions could be reduced. The uniqueness of the package in its role makes replacement challenging, but the impact of its absence would be manageable.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action on @types/node's abandonment is low. The TypeScript ecosystem is stable, and Node.js itself is a foundational technology with a long support horizon. Changes that would necessitate action on this dependency are unlikely in the near to medium term.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, @types/node's abandonment would have a low impact on the Lumeer/web-ui project. Its role is supportive rather than foundational, and its integration into the project is not deep. While there are no direct alternatives, the project's reliance on Node.js APIs appears minimal, reducing the potential impact of its abandonment.",

      "reasoning": "Codelyzer is a static code analysis tool specifically designed for Angular projects. It enforces best practices and coding standards, which are crucial for maintaining code quality in large projects like Lumeer/web-ui. Given that Lumeer/web-ui is an Angular project, the functionality provided by Codelyzer is highly important for ensuring that the codebase adheres to Angular's style guide and best practices.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Codelyzer is integrated into the project's linting process, as indicated by the presence of 'codelyzer' in the devDependencies of the package.json file and the 'lint' script that uses it. However, its integration is not deeply embedded into the core functionality of the application but rather serves as a tool for code quality checks. This makes it relatively easier to replace compared to core dependencies.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative static code analysis tools available for Angular projects, such as ESLint with the angular-eslint plugin. These alternatives can provide similar functionality to Codelyzer, making it feasible to replace Codelyzer if necessary. The availability of suitable alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacing Codelyzer.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Codelyzer's abandonment is moderate. While Codelyzer is a popular tool, the Angular ecosystem is evolving, and there is a trend towards using ESLint for static code analysis. However, as long as Codelyzer remains compatible with the project's Angular version and continues to meet the project's needs, the urgency to replace it due to external changes is not high.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of Codelyzer in enforcing coding standards and best practices in an Angular project, its abandonment would be impactful to the Lumeer/web-ui project. However, the availability of alternatives and the moderate level of integration make the impact manageable. The project would need to invest time in transitioning to an alternative tool, but the core functionality of the application would not be directly affected.",
