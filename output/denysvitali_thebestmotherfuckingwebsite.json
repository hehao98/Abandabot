    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The copy-webpack-plugin is used to copy files from the source directory to the build directory. In this project, it is configured to copy files from 'src/dist/' to './'. This functionality is crucial for the build process as it ensures that necessary files are available in the build directory for deployment. Without this plugin, the build process would be incomplete, and the website would not function as intended.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The plugin is integrated into the project's webpack configuration file (webpack.config.js) and is used in the plugins array. It is configured with a specific pattern to copy files from 'src/dist/' to './'. The integration is straightforward and does not involve complex configurations or deep integration into the codebase. However, its role in the build process is essential, making it a critical part of the project's build system.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to copy-webpack-plugin, such as file-loader, cpy-cli, and ncp. These alternatives can also copy files and directories as part of the build process. However, copy-webpack-plugin is specifically designed for use with webpack, making it a more seamless and integrated solution for projects that use webpack as their build tool. The availability of alternatives suggests that replacing the plugin is feasible, but it would require adjustments to the build configuration.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The plugin is widely used and maintained by the webpack community, reducing the risk of abandonment. Additionally, the functionality it provides is relatively stable and not subject to frequent changes in web development practices or standards. However, the risk is not zero, as any dependency could potentially be abandoned or become incompatible with future versions of webpack.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the copy-webpack-plugin to the project's build process, its straightforward integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would be impactful but manageable. The project could transition to an alternative solution if necessary, but the plugin's current role in the build process is critical.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The extract-loader is used in the webpack configuration to handle CSS and HTML files. Given the simplicity of the project, which is essentially a static website, the functionality provided by extract-loader is not critical. The project could potentially use other methods or loaders to achieve similar results without significant impact on the project's functionality.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The extract-loader is integrated into the webpack configuration at multiple points, indicating it plays a role in the build process. However, the integration does not appear to be deeply complex or critical. Replacing it would require adjustments to the webpack configuration but is feasible without overhauling the project's codebase.",

    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to extract-loader, such as the mini-css-extract-plugin and the extract-text-webpack-plugin, which offer similar functionality. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace extract-loader if necessary.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the nature of the project and its dependencies, there is a low likelihood that external environmental changes will force the project to act on the dependency's abandonment. The project is a static website with a straightforward build process, and changes in the webpack ecosystem are unlikely to necessitate immediate action.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the scores and reasoning provided for importance, integration, alternatives, and likelihood, the abandonment of extract-loader would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could adapt to its absence with minimal effort, and there are viable alternatives available.",

      "reasoning": "The raw-loader is used to import files as strings in the project. Given the simplicity of the project (a static website), the functionality provided by raw-loader is not critical. The project could potentially load files in other ways or even inline the content directly in the code without significant impact on the project's functionality or performance.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of raw-loader in the project appears to be minimal. It is listed as a devDependency in the package.json file, but there is no specific mention or evidence of extensive use in the project's build or deployment process. The project's README and the provided code snippets do not highlight any deep integration of raw-loader.",
