    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "TypeScript is crucial for the project as it is a fully typed TypeScript and Node.js SDK package for Amazon Selling Partner API. The project heavily relies on TypeScript for type safety, code quality, and developer productivity. The project's README emphasizes the use of TypeScript, and the package.json includes TypeScript as a devDependency, indicating its importance in the development process.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "TypeScript is deeply integrated into the project, as evidenced by the extensive use of TypeScript configurations, TypeScript-specific ESLint rules, and TypeScript in the build and development scripts. The project's codebase is written in TypeScript, and the project uses TypeScript for generating API models and other utilities. This deep integration makes replacing TypeScript a significant challenge.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to TypeScript, such as Flow or Babel with type annotations, none offer the same level of community support, tooling, and ecosystem integration as TypeScript. Given the project's reliance on TypeScript's features and the ecosystem, finding a suitable alternative that provides the same functionality and developer experience would be difficult.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on TypeScript's abandonment is low. TypeScript is widely adopted and supported by Microsoft, making it unlikely to be abandoned in the near future. However, the project should monitor the TypeScript ecosystem for any significant changes that could impact its use.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role TypeScript plays in the project's development, its deep integration into the codebase, the difficulty in finding suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of its abandonment, the abandonment of TypeScript would be highly impactful to the project. The project would face significant challenges in maintaining and evolving its codebase without TypeScript.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @scaleleap/semantic-release-config dependency is used for automating the release process of the project. While it plays a crucial role in ensuring smooth and standardized releases, its functionality is not directly tied to the core features of the Selling Partner API SDK, which is the main focus of the project. Therefore, its importance to the project's core functionality is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project through a single configuration file (release.config.js). This indicates a shallow level of integration, as it does not deeply intertwine with the project's codebase. Replacing or removing this dependency would primarily involve updating the release configuration, which is a relatively straightforward task.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives available for semantic release configurations, including the default semantic-release configuration and other shareable configurations provided by the community. These alternatives offer similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements with minimal adjustments to the project's release process.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The semantic release process is a well-established practice with a stable ecosystem. Changes that would necessitate immediate action, such as significant breaking changes in the semantic release tooling, are rare.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of the @scaleleap/semantic-release-config dependency to the project's core functionality, its shallow level of integration, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",
    "impactful": false

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The lodash library is used in the project for utility functions such as camelCase, upperFirst, and template. These functions are essential for generating API client and model names, which are core functionalities of the SDK. However, the usage is limited to a few specific utility functions, and the project could potentially implement these utilities internally or find alternative libraries.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Lodash is integrated into the project in a few specific files for utility functions. The integration is not deeply embedded into the core functionalities of the SDK, and replacing lodash would require changes in a limited number of places. The impact of replacing lodash is manageable but would require some effort to ensure compatibility and maintain functionality.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative libraries and native JavaScript methods that can provide similar utility functions as lodash. Libraries like Ramda, Underscore, or even native JavaScript methods could serve as suitable replacements. The availability of alternatives makes it less difficult to replace lodash in the project.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on lodash's abandonment is low. Lodash is a widely used and stable library with a large community and active maintenance. However, the possibility of future changes in the JavaScript ecosystem or specific project requirements could necessitate a reevaluation of dependency choices.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the limited and specific use of lodash in the project, the availability of alternative libraries, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of lodash would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could manage the replacement of lodash with minimal disruption.",
