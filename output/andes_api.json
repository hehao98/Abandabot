    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @andes/core dependency is extensively used across multiple modules in the project, including core functionalities like resource management, query handling, and authentication. Its usage is critical for the operation of the API, as evidenced by its integration into various routes and controllers.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is deeply integrated into the project, with its components being used in numerous routes, controllers, and schemas. It provides foundational functionalities that are leveraged across different parts of the application, making it a core part of the project's architecture.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives for specific functionalities provided by @andes/core, finding a single package that offers the same comprehensive set of features and is compatible with the existing codebase would be challenging. The dependency's unique features and the project's reliance on them make finding a suitable replacement difficult.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the dependency's critical role in the project and the lack of immediate alternatives, any environmental changes that lead to its abandonment would likely force the project to act. This includes changes in the dependency's maintenance status or compatibility issues with newer versions of other dependencies.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the critical role of @andes/core in the project, its deep integration, the difficulty in finding suitable alternatives, and the likelihood of environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would be highly impactful to the project. It would require significant effort to replace or mitigate the loss of its functionalities, affecting the project's stability and development timeline.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The 'http' dependency is used in various parts of the project, including configuration files, email templates, and API controllers. It is essential for making HTTP requests, which are crucial for the project's functionality, especially in modules that interact with external services and APIs.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The 'http' dependency is deeply integrated into the project, as evidenced by its usage in multiple modules and configuration files. Replacing it would require significant changes across the codebase, including updating import statements, modifying request handling logic, and ensuring compatibility with other dependencies.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to the 'http' dependency, such as 'axios' and 'node-fetch', which provide similar functionality for making HTTP requests. These alternatives are widely used and well-maintained, making them suitable replacements. However, switching to an alternative would still require code changes and testing to ensure compatibility.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given that 'http' is a core Node.js module, the likelihood of it being abandoned is extremely low. Node.js core modules are maintained by the Node.js team and are essential for the runtime's functionality. Therefore, external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment are highly unlikely.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the 'http' dependency to the project's functionality, its deep integration into the codebase, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of 'http' would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency 'tslint-eslint-rules' provides ESLint rules for TSLint, which is crucial for maintaining code quality and consistency in TypeScript projects. Given that the project 'andes/api' is a TypeScript project, the functionality provided by 'tslint-eslint-rules' is important for enforcing coding standards and catching potential errors early in the development process.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of 'tslint-eslint-rules' in the project is through the TSLint configuration file ('tslint.json'). This indicates a moderate level of integration, as it is used for linting purposes rather than being deeply embedded in the core functionality of the application. Replacing it would require updating the TSLint configuration and potentially modifying the linting rules to match those of an alternative package.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to 'tslint-eslint-rules' for integrating ESLint rules into TSLint, such as 'eslint-plugin-tslint' and 'typescript-eslint'. These alternatives provide similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace 'tslint-eslint-rules' if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the dependency is not directly tied to the runtime environment, changes in the TypeScript or ESLint ecosystems could necessitate a switch to a different linting solution. However, such changes would likely be gradual and allow for a planned migration.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of maintaining code quality and consistency in a TypeScript project, the abandonment of 'tslint-eslint-rules' would be impactful. However, the availability of suitable alternatives and the moderate level of integration reduce the overall impact. The project would need to invest time in migrating to an alternative linting solution, but this is manageable with proper planning.",
