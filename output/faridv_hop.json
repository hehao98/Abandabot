    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The hbbtv-typings dependency provides TypeScript typings for HbbTV 1.5, which is crucial for the HbbTV Open Platform (HOP) project as it is a TypeScript platform for creating HbbTV apps. The typings ensure that developers can work with HbbTV standards in a type-safe manner, which is essential for the project's core functionality. Given that HOP is specifically designed for HbbTV app development, the absence of these typings would significantly hinder development and maintenance.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of hbbtv-typings into the project appears to be straightforward, as it is added to the 'include' array of the tsconfig.json file. This suggests that the dependency is used globally across the project for type definitions. However, without specific code snippets showing the depth of its usage, it's challenging to assess the complexity of its integration fully. Based on the available information, the integration seems to be at a moderate level, not deeply intertwined with the project's core logic but essential for type safety.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "Finding alternatives to hbbtv-typings could be challenging because it provides specific TypeScript typings for HbbTV 1.5 standards. While it might be possible to manually create or find other typings for HbbTV, the specificity and official nature of hbbtv-typings make it a unique resource. The availability of suitable alternatives is limited, and any replacement would likely require significant effort to ensure compatibility and completeness.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low to moderate. HbbTV standards are relatively stable, and changes that would necessitate immediate action on the typings are infrequent. However, if the HbbTV standards were to undergo significant updates or if the typings were to become incompatible with newer TypeScript versions, the project might need to address the dependency's abandonment.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of hbbtv-typings to the project's core functionality, the moderate level of integration, the limited availability of alternatives, and the low to moderate likelihood of external changes necessitating action, the abandonment of hbbtv-typings would likely be impactful to the HbbTV Open Platform project. The dependency plays a crucial role in ensuring type safety and adherence to HbbTV standards, making its maintenance and availability essential for the project's success.",

      "reasoning": "The @types/jasmine package provides TypeScript definitions for Jasmine, which is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. Given that the project uses Jasmine for testing, as indicated by the presence of 'jasmine' and 'karma-jasmine' in the devDependencies, the @types/jasmine package is crucial for ensuring type safety and enhancing the development experience when writing tests in TypeScript. However, its importance is somewhat mitigated by the fact that it is a development dependency and not directly involved in the production build or runtime of the application.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/jasmine package is integrated into the project as a development dependency, primarily used for type definitions in the testing environment. Its integration depth is moderate, as it is essential for the development and testing phases but does not affect the core functionality or the production build of the application. Replacing it would require finding an alternative source for Jasmine's TypeScript definitions, which could be time-consuming but not insurmountable.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative ways to obtain TypeScript definitions for Jasmine, such as manually writing the definitions or using other type definition packages if available. However, @types/jasmine is the most straightforward and widely used solution for this purpose. The availability of direct alternatives is limited, making the replacement somewhat challenging but not impossible.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. TypeScript definitions for popular libraries like Jasmine are generally well-maintained, and the community or the TypeScript team might step in to provide alternatives if @types/jasmine were to be abandoned. Additionally, since it's a development dependency, the impact of its abandonment on the project's runtime or production build is minimal.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, the abandonment of @types/jasmine would have a moderate impact on the project. It is important for the development and testing phases, ensuring type safety and enhancing the developer experience. However, its impact is limited to the development environment, and there are potential alternatives, albeit with some effort required for integration. The likelihood of being forced to act due to external changes is low. Therefore, while the abandonment would be noteworthy, it would not be directly impactful to the project's core functionality or production build.",

      "reasoning": "The copy-webpack-plugin is used to copy static files directly without any processing. In the context of the HbbTV Open Platform (HOP) project, it is used to copy assets and a .htaccess file. While this functionality is useful, it is not critical to the core functionality of the project, which is to create fast and optimized HbbTV apps. The project could potentially find alternative ways to handle static files or even manually copy them if necessary. Therefore, the importance of this dependency is moderate.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The copy-webpack-plugin is integrated into the project's webpack configuration file (webpack.config.js) to copy static files. The integration is straightforward and limited to a specific section of the configuration file. Replacing or removing this plugin would require minimal changes to the webpack configuration. Therefore, the depth of its integration in the project's code base is low.",

    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages that could serve as suitable replacements for copy-webpack-plugin, such as file-loader or even custom scripts for copying files. These alternatives could provide similar functionality with minimal changes to the project's configuration. Therefore, the availability of alternative packages is high.",

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The functionality provided by copy-webpack-plugin is not highly specialized or dependent on external factors. The project could continue to use the plugin as long as it is maintained, or switch to an alternative without significant impact. Therefore, the likelihood of being forced to act on the dependency's abandonment is low.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of the functionality provided by copy-webpack-plugin, the low depth of its integration in the project's code base, the high availability of alternative packages, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment, the abandonment of copy-webpack-plugin would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",
