    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The ali-oss dependency is used in the project for uploading artifacts to Alibaba Cloud OSS. This functionality is crucial for the deployment process, as it allows the project to distribute its builds and updates. The dependency is directly referenced in the deployment script, indicating its importance in the project's CI/CD pipeline.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of ali-oss in the project is limited to a single script (upload-ali-oss.js) used for deployment. The script initializes the OSS client and uses it to upload files. This indicates a shallow integration, as the dependency is not deeply embedded in the project's core codebase but is instead used for a specific, isolated task.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to ali-oss for interacting with Alibaba Cloud OSS, such as using the Alibaba Cloud SDK for Node.js or other third-party libraries that support OSS. These alternatives could potentially provide similar functionality. However, switching to an alternative would require changes to the deployment script and possibly adjustments to the CI/CD pipeline.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. Alibaba Cloud OSS is a core service of Alibaba Cloud, and it is unlikely to be abandoned. However, if the dependency were to be abandoned, the project would need to find an alternative solution for uploading artifacts, which could impact the deployment process.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the importance of the ali-oss dependency in the project's deployment process, its abandonment would be impactful. However, the shallow integration and the availability of alternatives mitigate the impact. The project would need to update its deployment script to use an alternative solution, but this would not require extensive changes to the core codebase.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @commitlint/config-angular dependency is used to enforce commit message conventions in the project. While maintaining a consistent commit message style is beneficial for project maintainability and collaboration, it is not directly related to the core functionality of the Agora Flat project, which focuses on real-time interaction and classroom management. Therefore, the functionality provided by this dependency is of moderate importance to the project.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project through a configuration file (.commitlintrc.js) that extends the @commitlint/config-angular rules. This indicates a shallow integration, as the dependency is not deeply embedded in the project's codebase. Replacing or removing this dependency would primarily involve updating or removing the configuration file, which is a relatively straightforward task.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available that can enforce commit message conventions, such as @commitlint/config-conventional. These alternatives provide similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements with minimal adjustments to the project's configuration. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace @commitlint/config-angular if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. Commit message conventions are generally stable and not subject to rapid changes in the external environment. Additionally, the project could continue to function without strict enforcement of commit message conventions, albeit with potential impacts on maintainability and collaboration.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of the functionality provided by @commitlint/config-angular, its shallow integration into the project, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/react package provides TypeScript definitions for React, which is a core library used in the project for building the user interface. Given that the project is a client application for an open-source classroom, React's functionality is crucial for rendering the UI components and managing the state across the application. The absence of TypeScript definitions would make development more challenging and error-prone, especially in a large project like this.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/react package is deeply integrated into the project as it is a TypeScript project that uses React for its UI. The package is listed in the devDependencies, indicating its essential role during the development phase. Replacing it would require significant changes to the codebase, including updating type definitions and potentially refactoring components to align with a different type system or library.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternative type definitions or ways to handle types in TypeScript projects, @types/react is the standard and most widely used package for React TypeScript definitions. Alternatives might not offer the same level of community support, documentation, or compatibility with the latest React features. However, in the worst-case scenario, the project could potentially switch to using PropTypes or another type-checking mechanism, though this would be less ideal.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is relatively low. The React ecosystem is large and well-supported, and @types/react is maintained by the DefinitelyTyped community, which is active and responsive. However, if React itself were to change significantly or if TypeScript were to introduce breaking changes, it could impact the dependency's usefulness.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @types/react to the project's development process, its deep integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @types/react would be impactful but not critically so. The project could manage with alternatives, though it would require significant effort.",
