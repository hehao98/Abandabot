    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @testing-library/react-native is used extensively in the project for testing various components and functionalities. It is crucial for ensuring the reliability and correctness of the code through automated tests. Given its widespread use across different test files, the functionality it provides is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is deeply integrated into the project's test suite, as evidenced by its usage across multiple test files for different components. Replacing it would require rewriting a significant portion of the test code, which indicates a high level of integration difficulty.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are other testing libraries available for React Native, @testing-library/react-native is specifically designed for React Native and encourages good testing practices. Finding a suitable alternative that provides the same level of functionality and ease of use could be challenging.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is relatively low. The project is well-maintained, and the dependency is widely used in the React Native community, reducing the risk of sudden abandonment.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @testing-library/react-native to the project's testing suite, its deep integration, the difficulty in finding suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would be highly impactful to the project.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The `prettier-plugin-import-sort` dependency is used for sorting imports in the project, which is a common practice to maintain code readability and consistency. However, its functionality, while beneficial, is not critical to the core functionality of the `react-native-toast-message` project, which is to display toast messages. The project could still function without this plugin, albeit with potentially less organized import statements.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of `prettier-plugin-import-sort` is minimal and primarily confined to the development environment. It is used in the `prettier` script within the `package.json` file, indicating its use is limited to code formatting tasks. This suggests that removing or replacing this dependency would not require extensive changes to the project's codebase.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives available for sorting imports in JavaScript and TypeScript projects, such as `eslint-plugin-import` and `import-sort` itself. These alternatives can provide similar functionality, making it relatively easy to replace `prettier-plugin-import-sort` if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The functionality provided by `prettier-plugin-import-sort` is not tied to any external services or APIs that could change or become unavailable. Additionally, the project's core functionality does not depend on this plugin, further reducing the likelihood of being forced to act on its abandonment.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the analysis, the abandonment of `prettier-plugin-import-sort` would not likely be directly impactful to the `react-native-toast-message` project. Its functionality, while useful for maintaining code quality, is not essential to the project's core features. Additionally, the ease of integration and availability of alternatives further mitigate the potential impact of its abandonment.",

  },
  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The functionality provided by lint-staged is important for maintaining code quality by running linters and formatters on staged files before committing. However, in the context of the react-native-toast-message project, which is focused on providing a toast message component for React Native, lint-staged is more of a development tool rather than a core functionality. It ensures code quality but does not directly impact the core features of the project.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "lint-staged is integrated into the project through the package.json scripts and the husky pre-commit hook. It runs predefined tasks like prettier and eslint on staged files. While it is integrated into the development workflow, replacing it would not require deep changes to the project's codebase. The integration is more about configuration and less about deeply embedded code logic.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to lint-staged, such as pre-commit, simple-git-hooks, and lefthook, which can also automate running tasks on staged files. These alternatives provide similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements. The availability of alternatives makes it less difficult to replace lint-staged.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on lint-staged's abandonment is low. lint-staged is a development tool, and its abandonment would not directly affect the runtime functionality of the react-native-toast-message project. The project could continue to use lint-staged as long as it is maintained or switch to an alternative without significant impact.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance, integration, alternatives, and likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of lint-staged would not likely be directly impactful to the react-native-toast-message project. It is a valuable tool for maintaining code quality but does not affect the core functionality of the project. There are also suitable alternatives available, making it easier to replace if necessary.",
