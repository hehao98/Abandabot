    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The eslint-config-prettier dependency is used to disable ESLint rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier. This is crucial for maintaining code quality and consistency in the project, especially when using Prettier for code formatting. Given that the project has a 'format' script that uses Prettier, the functionality provided by eslint-config-prettier is important to ensure that ESLint and Prettier work together without conflicts.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "eslint-config-prettier is integrated into the project's ESLint configuration, as indicated by its presence in the devDependencies and the 'lint' script in package.json. However, its integration is relatively straightforward and limited to the ESLint configuration. Replacing it would require updating the ESLint configuration but would not involve extensive changes across the codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative packages and configurations that can achieve similar functionality, such as manually configuring ESLint rules to not conflict with Prettier or using other ESLint plugins that provide similar functionality. However, eslint-config-prettier is widely used and recognized for this purpose, making it a preferred choice. The availability of alternatives does not significantly reduce the difficulty of replacement, as the project would still need to ensure that the chosen alternative works seamlessly with Prettier.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. eslint-config-prettier is a stable and widely used package, and its abandonment would likely be due to a significant shift in the JavaScript ecosystem, such as a major change in ESLint or Prettier. However, given the project's reliance on both ESLint and Prettier, such a shift could indeed necessitate action.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of eslint-config-prettier in ensuring that ESLint and Prettier work together without conflicts, its abandonment would be impactful to the project. However, the impact is mitigated by the relatively straightforward integration and the availability of alternative solutions. The project would need to find a suitable replacement and update its ESLint configuration, but this would not require extensive changes across the codebase.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The lodash.snakecase dependency is used to ensure that theme names are in snake_case format. This functionality is important for maintaining consistency in theme naming conventions within the project. However, it is a relatively minor feature that does not affect the core functionality of the project.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is used in a single script (scripts/preview-theme.js) to check if theme names are in snake_case format. Its usage is limited to a specific part of the project, and it is not deeply integrated into the core functionality or multiple parts of the codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available that can convert strings to snake_case format, such as 'snake-case' or 'change-case'. These alternatives are widely used and maintained, making it relatively easy to replace lodash.snakecase if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The functionality provided by lodash.snakecase is straightforward and unlikely to be affected by external changes. Additionally, the availability of alternative packages reduces the risk of being forced to act due to abandonment.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the limited importance of the functionality provided by lodash.snakecase, its shallow integration into the project, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @testing-library/jest-dom library is used across multiple test files in the project to extend jest with custom DOM matchers. This functionality is crucial for writing more declarative, clear, and maintainable tests. Given its widespread use in the project's test suite, the functionality provided by this dependency is highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project by importing it at the beginning of each test file. This indicates a shallow level of integration, as it does not deeply intertwine with the project's core logic but is essential for the testing environment. Replacing it would require updating each test file, which is manageable but time-consuming.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative libraries that provide similar functionality, such as chai-dom or expect-dom. However, @testing-library/jest-dom is specifically designed to work seamlessly with @testing-library/dom and jest, making it a preferred choice for projects already using these libraries. While alternatives exist, finding one that integrates as smoothly may be challenging.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The library is actively maintained and widely used in the JavaScript ecosystem. However, the risk is not zero, as any open-source project can become abandoned.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @testing-library/jest-dom to the project's testing suite, its shallow but widespread integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the dependency's abandonment would likely be impactful but not critically so. The project could transition to an alternative, though it would require effort.",
