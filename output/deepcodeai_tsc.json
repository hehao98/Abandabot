    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The lodash.omit function is used in multiple critical parts of the project, including handling bundle creation and analysis processes. Its functionality is essential for manipulating objects by omitting specified keys, which is a common requirement in the project's codebase. Given its widespread use and the critical nature of the tasks it supports, the functionality provided by lodash.omit is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "lodash.omit is integrated into several key components of the project, including bundle creation, analysis, and file handling. Its usage is not superficial; it is deeply embedded in the logic that processes and prepares data for analysis. Replacing it would require significant changes to the codebase, affecting multiple files and functions.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to lodash.omit, including native JavaScript methods and other utility libraries that offer similar functionality. However, the ease of replacement depends on the specific use cases and the extent to which the project relies on lodash.omit's unique features. While alternatives exist, the transition may not be straightforward due to the depth of integration and the need to ensure compatibility with existing code.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While lodash.omit is a stable and widely used package, the JavaScript ecosystem is dynamic, and changes in dependencies or their maintenance status can occur. However, given the package's popularity and the availability of alternatives, the immediate risk is not the highest.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of lodash.omit to the project's functionality, its deep integration, the availability of alternatives, and the likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of lodash.omit would be impactful. The project relies on it for critical operations, and while alternatives exist, the transition would require significant effort. Therefore, the dependency's abandonment would likely be directly impactful to the project.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency @types/lodash.union provides TypeScript definitions for the lodash.union function, which is used to create an array of unique values from multiple arrays. Given that the project is a TypeScript consumer of the Snyk Code public API, having accurate TypeScript definitions is crucial for type safety and development efficiency. However, the direct impact of this specific lodash utility function on the core functionality of the project seems limited, as it is just one of many utility functions provided by lodash.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @types/lodash.union in the project appears to be minimal. It is listed as a dependency in the package.json file, but there are no specific code snippets provided that show its usage in the project. This suggests that while it is part of the project's dependency tree, it may not be deeply integrated into the core functionality or critical paths of the application.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives available for @types/lodash.union, including other TypeScript definition packages for lodash utilities or even native TypeScript/JavaScript methods that can achieve similar functionality. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace @types/lodash.union if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The TypeScript ecosystem is stable, and changes that would necessitate immediate action on a type definition package are rare. Additionally, the specific functionality provided by lodash.union is not likely to be affected by external changes in the near future.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, the abandonment of @types/lodash.union would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The dependency's importance to the project is moderate, its integration is minimal, there are readily available alternatives, and the likelihood of external changes forcing action is low. Therefore, while it is a useful dependency, its abandonment would not significantly affect the project's functionality or development process.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @typescript-eslint/parser is used for linting TypeScript code, which is a critical part of maintaining code quality and consistency in a TypeScript project. Given that the project is a TypeScript consumer of the Snyk Code public API, ensuring the code adheres to TypeScript standards is essential. However, the direct impact on the core functionality of the project (interacting with the Snyk Code API) is limited.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project through the .eslintrc.json configuration file, specifying it as the parser for ESLint. This is a standard and straightforward integration point for ESLint configurations, indicating a shallow level of integration. Replacing it would primarily involve updating the ESLint configuration, which is not deeply embedded in the project's codebase.",

    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative parsers available for ESLint that can handle TypeScript, such as 'typescript-eslint-parser' (though it's deprecated) and 'babel-eslint' (for projects using Babel). However, @typescript-eslint/parser is the most actively maintained and recommended parser for TypeScript projects using ESLint. While alternatives exist, they may not offer the same level of support or compatibility.",

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The @typescript-eslint/parser is actively maintained by the TypeScript ESLint team, which is closely aligned with the TypeScript project itself. Changes in the TypeScript ecosystem that would necessitate a switch are unlikely in the near to medium term.",

    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of linting in maintaining code quality, the ease of replacing the dependency, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @typescript-eslint/parser would not be directly impactful to the project. The project could transition to an alternative parser with minimal disruption.",
