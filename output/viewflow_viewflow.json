    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The material-components-web library is used extensively across various components in the Viewflow project, including form rendering, list actions, field inputs, and UI elements like snackbars and progress indicators. This indicates that the library plays a crucial role in the UI/UX aspects of the project, making it highly important for maintaining the project's modern, responsive user interface.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The material-components-web library is deeply integrated into the Viewflow project, as evidenced by its usage in multiple components and templatetags. The library is directly imported and used in various parts of the codebase, suggesting that replacing it would require significant refactoring of the UI components.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are other UI component libraries available, such as Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS, finding a direct replacement that offers the same level of integration and functionality as material-components-web could be challenging. The project would need to evaluate and potentially adapt to the differences in API and design philosophy of alternative libraries.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the material-components-web library is widely used and maintained, the open-source ecosystem is unpredictable, and changes in the library's maintenance status could impact the project.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the extensive use of the material-components-web library across the Viewflow project for critical UI components, its abandonment would likely have a significant impact. The library's deep integration and the lack of direct alternatives with the same level of functionality and design consistency make it a crucial dependency for the project. Therefore, the abandonment of material-components-web would be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @iconfu/svg-inject dependency is used for injecting SVG files inline into the DOM, which is a specific functionality that enhances the styling and interactivity of SVGs. However, based on the provided project README and package.json, there is no direct mention or clear indication of how critical this functionality is to the core features of Viewflow, such as workflow management, CRUD operations, or reporting. Therefore, while it adds value, it does not seem to be a cornerstone of the project's functionality.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @iconfu/svg-inject within the project appears to be minimal or not deeply embedded in the core functionalities of Viewflow. The package.json lists it as a dependency, but without specific code snippets or detailed usage overview, it's challenging to assess the depth of its integration. Given the lack of evidence suggesting deep integration, it's reasonable to assume that replacing or removing this dependency would not significantly disrupt the project's codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available that provide similar functionality for injecting SVGs inline into the DOM, such as svg-injector and svg4everybody. These alternatives are well-maintained and could serve as suitable replacements for @iconfu/svg-inject. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace the dependency without a significant impact on the project's functionality.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The functionality provided by @iconfu/svg-inject is not directly tied to critical external systems or standards that are likely to change. Additionally, the availability of alternative packages reduces the risk associated with the dependency's abandonment.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the scores and reasoning provided for each of the four questions, it appears that the abandonment of the @iconfu/svg-inject dependency would not be directly impactful to the Viewflow project. The functionality it provides, while useful, is not critical to the core features of the project. Additionally, the dependency is not deeply integrated into the project's codebase, and there are suitable alternatives available. Therefore, the project is unlikely to be significantly affected by the dependency's abandonment.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @hotwired/turbo dependency is used to accelerate links and form submissions, decompose pages into independent contexts, and deliver page changes over WebSocket or in response to form submissions. Given that Viewflow aims to provide a modern, responsive user interface with an SPA-style look and feel, Turbo's functionality is crucial for achieving this goal. It directly impacts the user experience by making the application faster and more responsive.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Turbo is integrated into the project to enhance the user interface and experience. However, based on the provided context, there is no specific code snippet showing deep integration of Turbo within the Viewflow project. The integration seems to be at a level where it enhances the application's performance and user experience but does not appear to be deeply embedded in the core functionality of Viewflow.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @hotwired/turbo that can provide similar functionality, such as React for SPA-style applications, Vue.js, or even traditional AJAX calls for partial page updates. These alternatives are widely used and supported, making it feasible to replace Turbo if necessary. However, the ease of replacement would depend on how Turbo is currently used within the project.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Turbo's abandonment is relatively low. Turbo is a well-maintained project by a reputable organization (37signals LLC), and there is no immediate indication of it being abandoned. However, the open-source nature of the project means that the possibility, however small, always exists.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of Turbo to the project's user experience and the availability of alternatives, the abandonment of Turbo would be impactful but not critically so. The project could transition to an alternative solution with some effort, but the immediate impact on the user experience would be noticeable.",
