    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency 'umi-presets-pro' is crucial for the project as it provides essential configurations and presets for the Ant Design Pro framework. The project's README highlights the use of 'umi' as part of the state-of-the-art development stack, indicating its importance in the project's architecture. The dependency is directly referenced in the project's configuration file, further emphasizing its role in the project's setup and functionality.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of 'umi-presets-pro' is deep within the project, as evidenced by its direct usage in the 'config/config.ts' file. This file is fundamental for the project's configuration, suggesting that replacing this dependency would require significant changes to the project's setup and potentially its architecture.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are other presets and configurations available for 'umi', 'umi-presets-pro' is specifically tailored for Ant Design Pro, making it uniquely suited for this project. Finding an alternative that provides the same level of integration and functionality could be challenging, as it would need to be compatible with the project's specific requirements and architecture.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the dependency's specific tailoring for Ant Design Pro and its deep integration into the project, the likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is relatively low. However, changes in the broader ecosystem, such as updates to 'umi' or React, could indirectly impact the necessity to act.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance, integration depth, and the specificity of 'umi-presets-pro' to Ant Design Pro, the abandonment of this dependency would likely be directly impactful to the project. The project relies on it for essential configurations and presets, and finding a suitable replacement would be challenging. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor the status of this dependency closely.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/express package provides TypeScript definitions for the Express.js framework. Given that ant-design-pro is a React boilerplate and does not directly use Express.js in its core functionality, the importance of this dependency to the project is relatively low. It might be used in some development or testing scenarios, but it is not critical for the main functionality of the project.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Since @types/express is a TypeScript definition package and not directly integrated into the core functionality of ant-design-pro, its integration depth is minimal. It is likely used in specific scenarios such as development or testing environments rather than being deeply embedded in the project's codebase.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives available for TypeScript definitions of Express.js, including community-driven definitions and other type definition packages. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace @types/express if needed.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the abandonment of @types/express is low. Since the package is not critical to the project's core functionality, changes in its status are unlikely to have a significant impact.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the low importance, minimal integration, availability of alternatives, and low likelihood of external environmental changes, the abandonment of @types/express would not likely be directly impactful to the ant-design-pro project.",

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "React is a core dependency for the ant-design/ant-design-pro project, as it is a React boilerplate. The project heavily relies on React for building its UI components and managing the state. The functionality provided by React is fundamental to the project's existence and operation. Without React, the project would not be able to function as intended.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "React is deeply integrated into the ant-design/ant-design-pro project. It is used throughout the project's codebase, from the main application file (app.tsx) to various components and pages. The project's architecture is built around React, making it a central part of the project's structure. Replacing React would require a complete overhaul of the project's codebase, which would be a significant and complex task.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are other libraries and frameworks available for building user interfaces, such as Vue.js or Angular, they are not direct replacements for React. Each of these alternatives has its own ecosystem, patterns, and best practices. Migrating from React to another framework would not only require rewriting the code but also adapting to a different development paradigm. This makes finding a suitable replacement that provides the same functionality as React challenging.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given React's widespread adoption and active maintenance by Facebook and the open-source community, the likelihood of React being abandoned is extremely low. React continues to evolve with new features and improvements, and it remains a popular choice for building web applications. External environmental changes forcing the project to act on React's abandonment are highly unlikely.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the critical role React plays in the ant-design/ant-design-pro project, its deep integration into the project's codebase, the challenges in finding a suitable replacement, and the low likelihood of React being abandoned, the abandonment of React would be highly impactful to the project. The project's core functionality and architecture are built around React, making it indispensable.",
