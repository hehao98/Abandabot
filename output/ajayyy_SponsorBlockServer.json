    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The lru-cache dependency is used extensively in the project for caching purposes, particularly in the redis utility file. It is used to cache Redis command results, which is crucial for performance optimization by reducing the number of direct Redis queries. Given its role in enhancing the application's performance, the functionality provided by lru-cache is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The lru-cache is deeply integrated into the project's Redis utility functions. It is used in multiple functions for caching Redis command results, setting cache values, and handling cache invalidation. The dependency is intertwined with the Redis operations, making its replacement challenging without significant refactoring of the Redis utility code.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available that could serve as suitable replacements for lru-cache, such as node-cache, memory-cache, and quick-lru. These alternatives offer similar functionality and could potentially be used with some adjustments to the code. However, the specific features and performance characteristics of lru-cache might require careful consideration when selecting an alternative.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the project could continue to function with an abandoned lru-cache dependency for some time, security vulnerabilities, compatibility issues with newer Node.js versions, or the need for new features could eventually necessitate action.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of lru-cache to the project's performance, its deep integration into the Redis utility functions, the availability of alternative packages, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of lru-cache would likely be impactful to the project. The project would need to either find a suitable replacement or continue using an abandoned dependency, both of which could require significant effort.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin is a development dependency used for linting TypeScript code. While linting is important for maintaining code quality and consistency, it is not directly involved in the core functionality of the SponsorBlockServer project. Therefore, its importance to the project is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin is integrated into the project through the ESLint configuration, which is used in the 'lint' and 'lint:fix' scripts. However, its integration is not deeply embedded into the core logic or functionality of the project. Replacing it would primarily involve updating the ESLint configuration and possibly some linting rules.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative linting tools and plugins available for TypeScript, such as TSLint (though it is deprecated) and other ESLint plugins. However, @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin is the most widely used and recommended plugin for linting TypeScript code with ESLint. Finding a suitable alternative would require some research and testing but is feasible.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin is actively maintained and widely used in the TypeScript community. However, if it were to be abandoned, the project could continue to use the last stable version for a considerable time before needing to find a replacement.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "The @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin is important for maintaining code quality through linting but is not critical to the core functionality of the SponsorBlockServer project. Its integration is not deeply embedded, and there are feasible alternatives available. The likelihood of needing to act on its abandonment is low. Therefore, its abandonment would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The `nyc` dependency is used for code coverage reporting in the project. While code coverage is important for maintaining code quality, it is not directly related to the core functionality of the project. Therefore, its importance is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of `nyc` in the project is minimal. It is used in the `scripts` section of `package.json` for running tests with coverage and generating coverage reports. There is no deep integration in the codebase, making it relatively easy to replace.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to `nyc` for code coverage in JavaScript/TypeScript projects, such as `jest`, `c8`, and `istanbul`. These alternatives provide similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on `nyc`'s abandonment is low. Code coverage tools are generally stable, and there are multiple alternatives available. Additionally, the project's use of `nyc` is not deeply integrated, reducing the impact of its abandonment.",
      "score": 1
