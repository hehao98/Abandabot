    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @testing-library/react-hooks package is used extensively in the project for testing custom hooks, which are a critical part of the project's functionality. The package is used in multiple test files to ensure that the hooks behave as expected. Given the project's reliance on custom hooks for its core functionality, the testing of these hooks is crucial for maintaining the project's quality and reliability.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @testing-library/react-hooks package is deeply integrated into the project's test suite. It is used in multiple test files to render hooks and assert their behavior. The package's functions are directly called in the test files, indicating a high level of integration. Replacing this package would require significant changes to the test suite, including rewriting test cases to use a different testing library.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative packages available for testing React hooks, such as react-testing-library and enzyme. However, these alternatives may not provide the same level of simplicity and utility specifically for testing hooks as @testing-library/react-hooks does. The project would need to evaluate these alternatives to determine if they meet the project's testing needs, which could involve additional development effort.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. The React ecosystem is active, and changes in React or related libraries could impact the utility of @testing-library/react-hooks. However, the package is widely used and maintained, reducing the likelihood of sudden abandonment without alternatives or migration paths being available.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the importance of the @testing-library/react-hooks package to the project's test suite, its deep integration, and the availability of alternatives, the abandonment of this package would be impactful but not critically so. The project would need to invest effort in finding and integrating an alternative, but the core functionality of the project would not be directly affected.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The babel-preset-gatsby dependency is crucial for the project as it is used in the jest-preprocess.js file, which is essential for testing the Gatsby themes. Testing is a fundamental part of the development process, ensuring that the themes work as expected across different scenarios. Given its role in the testing setup, the functionality provided by babel-preset-gatsby is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project through the jest-preprocess.js file, which is a key part of the testing setup. However, its usage is limited to this specific file, indicating a moderate level of integration. Replacing it would require changes to the jest-preprocess.js file but would not necessitate widespread changes across the codebase.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative Babel presets available that could potentially replace babel-preset-gatsby, such as babel-preset-env or custom Babel configurations. However, these alternatives may require additional configuration and testing to ensure compatibility with Gatsby's specific requirements. The availability of alternatives, albeit with some effort, suggests a moderate difficulty level in replacing the dependency.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. Babel-preset-gatsby is specifically designed for Gatsby projects, and as long as Gatsby continues to support Babel, the need for immediate action due to external changes is minimal. However, if Gatsby were to significantly change its Babel requirements, it could impact the dependency's relevance.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of babel-preset-gatsby in the project's testing setup, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives with some effort, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of babel-preset-gatsby would be somewhat impactful but not critically so. The project could manage the transition to an alternative with reasonable effort.",

      "reasoning": "ESLint is a crucial tool for maintaining code quality and consistency in JavaScript projects. It helps in identifying problematic patterns and enforcing coding standards. Given that the project is a Gatsby theme used by multiple New Relic sites, maintaining high code quality is essential. ESLint's role in this process is significant, as it is integrated into the development workflow and used across various components and files.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "ESLint is deeply integrated into the project's development workflow, as evidenced by its presence in the package.json file and the .eslintrc.js configuration file. It is used across multiple components and files, indicating a broad integration within the codebase. Replacing ESLint would require updating the configuration and potentially modifying the code to comply with a different linter's rules.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternative linting tools available, such as JSHint and TSLint, ESLint's extensive plugin ecosystem and configurability make it a preferred choice for many projects. Finding a replacement that offers the same level of flexibility and community support could be challenging. However, the availability of alternatives does provide some options for replacement, albeit with potential trade-offs in functionality and ease of use.",

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on ESLint's abandonment is relatively low. ESLint is widely used and supported by a large community, making it unlikely to be abandoned without notice. However, changes in the JavaScript ecosystem or the emergence of a significantly better tool could potentially influence the project's decision to switch.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of ESLint in maintaining code quality, its deep integration into the project, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of ESLint would likely be impactful to the project. However, the impact could be mitigated by the availability of alternative tools and the project's ability to adapt to changes.",
