    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The `pgsql-parser` dependency is used for parsing and deparsing SQL queries into AST and back, which is a core functionality for the `POST /parse` endpoint in the project. This functionality is crucial for the project's ability to manage and manipulate SQL queries, making the dependency highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project's codebase through a single import in `src/lib/Parser.ts`. Its usage is limited to parsing and deparsing SQL queries, indicating a shallow integration. Replacing it would require changes in a minimal part of the codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative packages available that can parse SQL queries into AST, such as `pg-query-native` and `sql-parser`. These alternatives provide similar functionalities, making it feasible to replace `pgsql-parser` with another package.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the dependency's active development status and its integration with the latest PostgreSQL version, the likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. However, the dependency's abandonment could still impact the project if no maintenance updates are provided in the future.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the functionality provided by `pgsql-parser` to the project, its shallow integration, the availability of alternative packages, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of `pgsql-parser` would likely be impactful but manageable. The project could transition to an alternative package with moderate effort.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The `rimraf` dependency is used in the project's `package.json` for cleaning up directories during the build process. While it is a useful utility, it is not core to the functionality of the project, which is to provide a RESTful API for managing Postgres. The project could function without `rimraf` by using alternative methods for directory cleanup, though it might require some adjustments to the build scripts.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "`rimraf` is integrated into the project's build scripts, specifically in the `clean` script. Its usage is limited to this context, and it does not deeply integrate with the core functionality of the project. Replacing `rimraf` would require modifying the build scripts but would not affect the main codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to `rimraf` for directory cleanup, such as `fs-extra`, `del`, and native Node.js `fs` module methods. These alternatives can provide similar functionality with minimal changes to the build scripts. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace `rimraf`.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on `rimraf`'s abandonment is low. `rimraf` is a well-established package with a large user base, and its abandonment would likely be gradual, giving the project time to adapt. Additionally, the project's reliance on `rimraf` is minimal, reducing the impact of its potential abandonment.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the analysis, `rimraf` is not a critical dependency for the `supabase/pg-api` project. Its functionality is limited to the build process, and there are readily available alternatives. The project's reliance on `rimraf` is minimal, and its abandonment would not significantly impact the project's core functionality.",

      "reasoning": "The `ts-node` dependency is used in the development scripts of the project, specifically for running TypeScript files directly without precompiling them to JavaScript. This is crucial for development efficiency, allowing developers to run and test their TypeScript code directly. However, its importance is limited to the development phase and does not directly impact the production build or runtime of the project.",

Replacing it would require updating the development scripts but would not necessitate changes to the application's main functionality.",
