      "reasoning": "Bootstrap is a critical dependency for the project as it is used extensively throughout the project's frontend. It provides essential styling and components that are integral to the user interface. The project's SCSS files import Bootstrap's functions, variables, and mixins, and it is used in various components for layout, forms, and navigation. Given its widespread use, the functionality provided by Bootstrap is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Bootstrap is deeply integrated into the project's codebase. It is used in multiple components and SCSS files, and its variables and mixins are imported and overridden in the project's custom SCSS files. The project also uses Bootstrap's JavaScript components through the `@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap` package. Replacing Bootstrap would require significant refactoring of the project's styles and components, making it a difficult task.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternative CSS frameworks available, such as Tailwind CSS, Foundation, and Bulma, replacing Bootstrap would still be challenging. The project has customized Bootstrap's variables and relies on its specific mixins and functions. Additionally, the project uses `@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap`, which is tightly coupled with Bootstrap. Finding a suitable alternative that provides the same level of integration and functionality would be difficult.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Bootstrap is a widely used and actively maintained framework, making it unlikely to be abandoned in the near future. However, if external environmental changes, such as a major shift in web development practices or the emergence of a superior framework, were to occur, the project might be forced to consider alternatives. This scenario is currently unlikely but not impossible.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical importance of Bootstrap to the project's frontend, its deep integration, and the difficulty of finding suitable alternatives, the abandonment of Bootstrap would likely be directly impactful to the project. The project would face significant challenges in maintaining its current functionality and user experience without Bootstrap.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons package provides brand icons for the project. While these icons enhance the visual appeal and user experience, they are not critical to the core functionality of the event planning tool. The project could still function without these specific icons, albeit with a less polished appearance.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons appears to be straightforward, primarily used for displaying brand icons in the UI. The project uses Angular, and the package is likely integrated through Angular FontAwesome, which is designed for easy use with Angular applications. Replacing or removing this dependency would require updating the UI components that use these icons, but it does not seem deeply intertwined with the core logic of the application.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives available for brand icons, including other icon libraries like Material Icons, Ionicons, or even custom SVG icons. These alternatives can provide similar or even enhanced functionality. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons if necessary.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The package is part of the Font Awesome ecosystem, which is widely used and maintained. However, the open-source nature of the project means that there is always a risk, but it is not a high probability event.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the scores and reasoning provided for importance, integration, alternatives, and likelihood, the abandonment of @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The functionality provided by the dependency is not critical to the core operations of the event planning tool, and there are several viable alternatives available. Additionally, the integration is not deeply complex, making it relatively easy to replace if necessary.",

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core package is used for integrating Font Awesome icons into the project. Given the nature of the project (an event planner), icons are likely used for UI elements to enhance user experience. However, the core functionality of the event planner does not solely rely on these icons. Therefore, while the package is useful, it is not critical to the project's core functionality.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The package is integrated through the @fortawesome/angular-fontawesome package, which is a wrapper for Angular applications. The integration seems to be at a surface level, primarily for rendering icons. There is no indication of deep integration or custom modifications that would make replacement particularly difficult.",

    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Font Awesome, such as Material Icons, Ionicons, and others, which can provide similar functionality. These alternatives are well-maintained and widely used, making them suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacing @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core.",

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Font Awesome is a widely used and well-maintained library. The likelihood of it being abandoned in the near future is low. However, if it were to be abandoned, the impact on the project would be minimal due to the availability of alternatives and the non-critical nature of the package to the project's core functionality.",

    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance, integration depth, availability of alternatives, and likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core would not be directly impactful to the project. The package enhances the user interface but is not critical to the core functionality of the event planner. Additionally, the ease of replacement and low likelihood of abandonment further reduce the potential impact.",
