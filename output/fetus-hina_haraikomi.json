    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Bootstrap is used extensively throughout the project for front-end development, including modal dialogs, navigation bars, and other UI components. The project relies on Bootstrap for its responsive design and ease of use, making it a critical dependency for the project's user interface.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Bootstrap is deeply integrated into the project, as evidenced by its usage in multiple JavaScript files, PHP configurations, and asset management. The project uses Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins and CSS components extensively, indicating a high level of integration.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to Bootstrap, such as Foundation or Tailwind CSS, replacing Bootstrap would require significant refactoring of the project's front-end code. The project's reliance on Bootstrap's specific features and components makes finding a suitable alternative challenging.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given Bootstrap's widespread use and active maintenance, the likelihood of it being abandoned in the near future is low. However, the project's dependency on Bootstrap means that any future abandonment would have a significant impact, necessitating a proactive approach to dependency management.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the critical role Bootstrap plays in the project's front-end development, its deep integration, the challenges in finding suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of Bootstrap would be highly impactful to the project.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The semistandard package is used as a development tool for enforcing coding style standards in JavaScript. While it helps maintain code quality and consistency, its functionality is not critical to the core operation of the project, which is to generate PDFs for payment slips. The project could still function without it, albeit with potential inconsistencies in code style.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Semistandard is integrated into the project as a development dependency, primarily used during the testing phase to enforce coding standards. It is not deeply integrated into the core functionality of the project. Replacing it would mainly involve updating the development environment and possibly modifying the testing scripts.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to semistandard for enforcing JavaScript coding standards, such as ESLint with custom configurations, Prettier, or the standard package itself. These alternatives can provide similar functionality, making it relatively easy to replace semistandard if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. Semistandard is a tool for code style enforcement, and its abandonment would not directly impact the project's ability to generate PDFs. The project could continue using the current version of semistandard or switch to an alternative without significant disruption.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Given that semistandard is a development tool for enforcing coding standards and not critical to the core functionality of the project, its abandonment would have minimal impact. The project could continue to operate effectively without it, and there are several viable alternatives available. Therefore, the abandonment of semistandard would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The project uses Terser in the build process to minify JavaScript files. This is a common practice to reduce the size of JavaScript files for production, which can improve load times and performance. However, the project's README does not indicate that Terser is used for any critical functionality beyond minification. Therefore, while Terser is important for the build process, it is not critical to the core functionality of the project.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Terser is integrated into the project's build process as indicated in the Makefile. It is used to minify JavaScript files after they are processed by Babel. The integration is straightforward and limited to the build process, which means that replacing Terser would primarily involve changes to the build configuration rather than the project's source code.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Terser for JavaScript minification, such as UglifyJS, Babel Minify, and ESBuild. These alternatives offer similar functionality and could potentially be used as replacements with some adjustments to the build process. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace Terser.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Terser's abandonment is low. Terser is a widely used tool with a large community and active maintenance. While any open-source project can be abandoned, the risk of Terser being abandoned without a suitable replacement or fork is minimal.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of Terser in the build process, the ease of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of Terser would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could transition to an alternative minification tool with minimal disruption.",
