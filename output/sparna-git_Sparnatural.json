    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The mini-css-extract-plugin is used to extract CSS into separate files, which is crucial for optimizing the loading of CSS/JS resources in production builds. Given that Sparnatural is a visual client-side SPARQL query builder, its performance and user experience are highly dependent on the efficient loading and execution of CSS and JavaScript. Therefore, the functionality provided by mini-css-extract-plugin is very important for the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The mini-css-extract-plugin is integrated into the project's webpack configuration, specifically in the rules for processing CSS and SCSS files. It is used as a loader in the webpack configuration, indicating a moderate level of integration. However, replacing it would require adjustments to the webpack configuration but would not necessitate extensive changes to the project's codebase.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative packages that can extract CSS into separate files, such as extract-text-webpack-plugin. However, mini-css-extract-plugin is recommended for webpack 5 due to its support for On-Demand-Loading of CSS and SourceMaps, and its performance benefits. While alternatives exist, they may not provide the same level of functionality or performance.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The project is built on webpack 5, which is a stable and widely used module bundler. The mini-css-extract-plugin is specifically designed for webpack 5, and there is no immediate indication that webpack 5 will become obsolete or that the plugin will be abandoned.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the mini-css-extract-plugin for optimizing CSS loading in production builds, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives with potentially less functionality, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of mini-css-extract-plugin would likely be impactful to the project. However, the impact could be mitigated by switching to an alternative plugin, albeit with potential trade-offs in functionality and performance.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The jquery-nice-select dependency is used to replace native select elements with customizable dropdowns in the Sparnatural project. Given that Sparnatural is a visual SPARQL query builder that heavily relies on user interface components for query construction, the functionality provided by jquery-nice-select is crucial for enhancing the user experience. The dropdown list widget is one of the nine ways Sparnatural offers for selecting a value for a criteria, indicating its importance in the project's core functionality.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of jquery-nice-select in the Sparnatural project appears to be minimal, with only a few lines of code directly referencing it. The dependency is included in the project's assets and initialized in the SparnaturalElement.ts file. This suggests that while the dependency is used, it is not deeply integrated into the project's codebase, making it relatively easier to replace if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available that could serve as suitable replacements for jquery-nice-select, such as Select2, which is already a dependency in the project. These alternatives offer similar or even enhanced functionality for creating customizable dropdowns. The availability of these alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacing jquery-nice-select.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the dependency is important for the user interface, the project could potentially switch to an alternative if jquery-nice-select were to be abandoned. However, any such change would require some effort to ensure compatibility and maintain the user experience.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the functionality provided by jquery-nice-select to the Sparnatural project, its minimal integration, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of jquery-nice-select would be somewhat impactful but not critically so. The project could transition to an alternative with some effort, minimizing the direct impact on the project.",

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "@babel/core is a crucial part of the build process for the Sparnatural project, as it is used to transpile modern JavaScript and TypeScript code into a format that is compatible with older browsers. Given that Sparnatural is a client-side application, ensuring compatibility across different browsers is essential for its functionality. The project's reliance on @babel/core for its build process indicates a high level of importance.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "@babel/core is integrated into the project's build process, as indicated by its presence in the devDependencies section of the package.json file. It is used in conjunction with webpack and babel-loader to transpile the project's code. While this integration is significant, it is also modular and could be replaced with another transpiler if necessary. The integration is deep but not so intertwined that it would be impossible to replace.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @babel/core for JavaScript and TypeScript transpilation, such as TypeScript's own tsc compiler, esbuild, and swc. These alternatives offer similar functionality and could potentially serve as replacements. However, switching to an alternative would require adjustments to the build configuration and potentially some code changes, depending on the chosen alternative.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on @babel/core's abandonment is relatively low. The JavaScript ecosystem is stable, and @babel/core is a widely used and actively maintained project. However, the possibility of a critical security vulnerability or a significant shift in the ecosystem could necessitate action.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @babel/core to the project's build process, its integration depth, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @babel/core would be impactful but not critically so. The project could transition to an alternative transpiler with some effort, but the process would require careful planning and execution to avoid disruptions.",
