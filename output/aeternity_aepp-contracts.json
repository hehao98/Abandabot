    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The CodeMirror dependency is used for providing a code editor interface within the application. Given that the project is focused on testing Aeternity Smart Contracts, the ability to write and edit code directly within the application is crucial. Therefore, the functionality provided by CodeMirror is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "CodeMirror is integrated into the project through the 'vue-codemirror' package, which suggests a Vue.js wrapper around CodeMirror. This indicates a moderate level of integration, as it is not directly embedded into the core logic but is used for the user interface. Replacing it would require changes to the UI components that use the code editor.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to CodeMirror, such as Monaco Editor (used in VS Code) and Ace. These alternatives provide similar functionalities and could serve as suitable replacements. However, switching to an alternative would require some effort to adapt the UI components and ensure compatibility with the Vue.js framework.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on CodeMirror's abandonment is low. CodeMirror is a well-established project with a large user base, and its abandonment would be unexpected. However, the open-source nature of the project means that the possibility cannot be entirely ruled out.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of CodeMirror to the project's functionality, its moderate level of integration, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of its abandonment, the abandonment of CodeMirror would be impactful but not critically so. The project could transition to an alternative with some effort.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency 'vue-tsc' is used in the build process of the project, specifically for type checking Vue components with TypeScript. Given that the project is a Vue.js application that utilizes TypeScript, 'vue-tsc' plays a crucial role in ensuring type safety and preventing potential runtime errors. Its importance is high because it directly affects the quality and reliability of the build output.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "'vue-tsc' is integrated into the project's build script, which is a fundamental part of the development and deployment process. However, its integration is limited to the build phase and does not deeply affect the runtime behavior or the core functionality of the application. Replacing it would require adjustments to the build process but would not necessitate extensive changes to the application's codebase.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternatives to 'vue-tsc' for type checking Vue components with TypeScript, such as using the TypeScript compiler directly with custom configurations or leveraging other build tools that support TypeScript. However, 'vue-tsc' is specifically designed for Vue.js and TypeScript, making it a more straightforward and integrated solution. While alternatives exist, they may require additional configuration and might not offer the same level of convenience and integration.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on 'vue-tsc's abandonment is relatively low. The TypeScript and Vue.js ecosystems are stable, and 'vue-tsc' is a well-maintained tool within these ecosystems. However, changes in TypeScript or Vue.js that affect type checking could potentially impact the relevance or necessity of 'vue-tsc'.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of 'vue-tsc' in ensuring type safety in a Vue.js and TypeScript project, its abandonment could have a significant impact on the project's build process and overall code quality. However, the availability of alternatives and the relatively low likelihood of external changes forcing action mitigate the potential impact. The project would need to find a replacement or adjust its build process, but this would not fundamentally disrupt the application's functionality.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @typescript-eslint/parser is used for parsing TypeScript code in the ESLint configuration. While it is important for ensuring code quality and consistency, it is not directly involved in the core functionality of the Aeternity Contracts application, which is focused on smart contract interaction and deployment. Therefore, its importance to the project is moderate.",

    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative parsers available for TypeScript code in ESLint, such as the default ESLint parser or other community-supported parsers. These alternatives could serve as suitable replacements with minimal changes to the ESLint configuration.",

      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low.
