    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The project relies on gulp for compiling SCSS and JavaScript files, which are essential for the front-end functionality of the plugin. The README explicitly mentions using gulp for this purpose, indicating its critical role in the development workflow.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Gulp is deeply integrated into the project's build process, as evidenced by the gulpfile.js which contains multiple tasks for compiling SCSS and JavaScript, and watching for changes. The project's README also instructs developers to use gulp for compiling assets, showing its central role in the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to gulp, such as webpack, grunt, and parcel, which can also automate tasks in the development workflow. However, switching to an alternative would require rewriting the build scripts and potentially adjusting the project's configuration, which could be time-consuming.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "While gulp is a widely used tool with a strong ecosystem, the JavaScript ecosystem is known for its rapid changes. If gulp were to be abandoned, it could force the project to find an alternative build tool, especially if security vulnerabilities or compatibility issues arise.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given gulp's critical role in compiling assets and its deep integration into the project's build process, its abandonment would likely be impactful. However, the availability of alternatives and the current stability of gulp mitigate the urgency of such an impact.",
    "impactful": true

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The project uses Sass for compiling SCSS files into CSS, which is a critical part of the front-end development process. The project's README explicitly mentions that SCSS files are compiled into CSS, indicating that Sass plays a significant role in the project's styling workflow. Given that styling is a fundamental aspect of any web project, the functionality provided by Sass is highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Sass is integrated into the project through the use of `gulp-sass`, which is a Gulp plugin for compiling Sass files. The integration is straightforward and limited to the build process, specifically within the `gulpfile.js`. This indicates that while Sass is essential for the build process, its integration is not deeply embedded into the core logic of the project. Replacing Sass would primarily involve finding an alternative CSS preprocessor and adjusting the build process accordingly.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Sass, such as Less, Stylus, and PostCSS, which can also compile CSS preprocessor syntax into standard CSS. These alternatives are widely used and supported, making them suitable replacements for Sass. The availability of these alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacing Sass in the project.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Sass's abandonment is relatively low. Sass is a well-established tool with a large community and ongoing development. While any software can potentially be abandoned, the current state of Sass suggests that it is unlikely to be abandoned in the near future. However, the project should still monitor the health and activity of the Sass project to stay informed about any significant changes.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of Sass in the project's styling workflow, its relatively shallow integration, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of Sass would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could transition to an alternative CSS preprocessor with moderate effort, minimizing the impact of Sass's potential abandonment.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The browser-sync dependency is used in the project for live reloading and synchronization of browsers during development. While it enhances the development experience by providing real-time feedback on changes, it is not directly involved in the core functionality of the project, which is to manage leads and forms. Therefore, its importance to the project's core functionality is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of browser-sync in the project is minimal. It is only used in the gulpfile.js for development purposes, specifically for initializing browser synchronization and watching for changes in SCSS and JS files. There are no deep integrations or critical dependencies on browser-sync within the project's codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to browser-sync that provide similar functionality, such as LiveReload, Webpack Dev Server, and others. These alternatives can offer live reloading and synchronization features, making it relatively easy to replace browser-sync if needed.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on browser-sync's abandonment is low. Since browser-sync is primarily a development tool, its abandonment would not directly impact the production environment or the core functionality of the project. The project could continue to function without it, albeit with a potentially less efficient development process.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, browser-sync's abandonment would not be directly impactful to the project. It is a development tool that enhances the development experience but is not critical to the project's core functionality. There are also viable alternatives available, and its integration in the project is minimal. Therefore, the abandonment of browser-sync would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",
