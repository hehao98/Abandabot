    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The cypress-cucumber-preprocessor is used extensively in the project for end-to-end testing, as evidenced by the numerous step definition files that import and use it. This indicates that the functionality provided by this dependency is crucial for the project's testing framework, ensuring that the application behaves as expected across various scenarios.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is deeply integrated into the project's end-to-end testing framework, as shown by its usage in multiple step definition files and the plugins configuration. Replacing it would require significant refactoring of the test codebase, including rewriting step definitions and possibly altering the test execution workflow.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to cypress-cucumber-preprocessor for integrating Cucumber with Cypress, such as cypress-cucumber-preprocessor-steps or custom implementations, finding a suitable replacement that offers the same level of functionality and ease of use could be challenging. The project's reliance on specific features and the integration depth would make transitioning to an alternative non-trivial.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the dependency is actively maintained, the JavaScript ecosystem is known for its rapid changes, and a shift in the ecosystem or the dependency's maintenance status could necessitate action. However, there is no immediate indication that such a change is imminent.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role of cypress-cucumber-preprocessor in the project's end-to-end testing framework, its abandonment would likely be directly impactful. The dependency's deep integration and the lack of straightforward alternatives mean that its abandonment would require significant effort to mitigate, affecting the project's testing capabilities and potentially its overall quality assurance processes.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @angular/animations package is used in the project to handle animations in the UI components. While animations enhance user experience, they are not critical to the core functionality of the Ever Gauzy Platform, which is a business management platform. The absence of animations would not prevent the platform from performing its primary functions such as ERP, CRM, HRM, etc. Therefore, the functionality provided by @angular/animations is of moderate importance to the project.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @angular/animations package is integrated into the project through Angular's animation framework, which is used in specific components like the gallery and image viewer. The integration is not deeply embedded across the entire codebase but is localized to certain UI components. Replacing or removing this dependency would require updating the animation logic in these components, which is manageable but not trivial.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @angular/animations for handling animations in Angular applications, such as GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and Anime.js. These libraries offer similar or even more advanced animation capabilities. However, switching to an alternative would require some effort to refactor the existing animation logic in the components. The availability of suitable alternatives makes the replacement feasible but not without some development effort.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the abandonment of @angular/animations is low. Angular is a widely used framework with a strong community and long-term support. The @angular/animations package is part of the Angular ecosystem and is likely to be maintained as long as Angular itself is maintained. Therefore, the risk of abandonment is minimal.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of the functionality provided by @angular/animations, the manageable level of integration in the project, the availability of alternative animation libraries, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of @angular/animations would not likely be directly impactful to the Ever Gauzy Platform. The project could continue to function without significant issues, and any necessary adjustments could be made with reasonable effort.",

      "reasoning": "The @fortawesome/angular-fontawesome package is used to integrate Font Awesome icons into Angular applications. Given the project's extensive use of UI components and the need for a consistent and visually appealing interface, the functionality provided by this dependency is crucial. It enhances the user experience by providing a wide range of icons that are easily integrated into the application.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project through Angular modules and components. It is used in various parts of the application to display icons, which means it is deeply embedded in the UI layer. Replacing it would require updating all instances where Font Awesome icons are used, which could be time-consuming and error-prone.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative icon libraries available, such as Material Icons or Ionicons, which could potentially replace Font Awesome. However, these alternatives may not offer the same range of icons or the same level of integration with Angular. The availability of alternatives is moderate, but the effort to switch and the potential impact on the UI consistency must be considered.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. Font Awesome is a widely used and well-maintained library with a large community. However, the risk is not zero, as any open-source project could potentially be abandoned or face issues that affect its usability.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the @fortawesome/angular-fontawesome package to the project's UI, the depth of its integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would be impactful. It would require significant effort to replace and could affect the consistency and quality of the user interface.",
