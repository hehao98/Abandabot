    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency @marionebl/option is used in multiple parts of the project, specifically in handling custom options for certificates. It provides essential functionality for unwrapping and handling optional values, which is crucial for the project's operation, especially in the context of certificate management. Given its usage across different components, its functionality is important to the project.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into several components of the project, including certificate handling and settings management. Its usage is spread across different files, indicating a moderate level of integration. However, the integration does not appear to be deeply embedded in the core functionalities of the project, suggesting that replacing it, while not trivial, would be manageable with some effort.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives available in the JavaScript ecosystem that provide similar functionality to @marionebl/option, such as lodash's get and set functions, or the use of TypeScript's optional chaining and nullish coalescing. These alternatives could serve as suitable replacements, making the replacement process less difficult.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The dependency is not directly tied to external services or APIs that could change or become unavailable. However, if the dependency were to become abandoned, it could lead to security vulnerabilities or compatibility issues with newer versions of other dependencies or the Node.js runtime.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the dependency to the project's functionality, its level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @marionebl/option would be somewhat impactful but not critically so. The project could manage the transition to an alternative with some effort, and the impact would be mitigated by the availability of suitable replacements.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The 'vue-advanced-cropper' dependency is used for advanced image cropping functionality within the project. Given that the project is a Nextcloud app for signing PDF documents, image cropping might be a secondary feature rather than a core functionality. However, if the app allows for image signatures or requires image manipulation for document signing, the importance could be higher. Without specific code snippets showing the usage of 'vue-advanced-cropper', it's challenging to assess its criticality to the project's main functionalities.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration depth of 'vue-advanced-cropper' in the project's codebase is not explicitly detailed in the provided context. However, given that it is listed among other dependencies in the package.json file, it suggests that it is used in the project. The difficulty of replacing this dependency would depend on how extensively it is used across the project and whether it is tightly coupled with other components. Without specific code snippets, it's difficult to assess the depth of integration accurately.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available for image cropping in Vue.js, such as 'vue-cropperjs' and 'vue-image-crop-upload'. These alternatives provide similar functionalities and could potentially serve as suitable replacements for 'vue-advanced-cropper'. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace the dependency, provided that the project's specific requirements can be met by these alternatives.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is relatively low. The 'vue-advanced-cropper' package is a specific tool for image cropping, and its abandonment would not directly impact the core functionalities of the project, which are centered around document signing. However, if the project heavily relies on image cropping for certain features, the likelihood could increase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the provided context, 'vue-advanced-cropper' does not appear to be a core dependency for the project's main functionalities. Its abandonment would likely have a minimal impact, especially given the availability of alternative packages and the secondary nature of image cropping in a document signing app. However, the actual impact would depend on the extent of its usage in the project, which is not fully detailed in the provided context.",

      "reasoning": "Vue is a core dependency in the project, used extensively across various components and views. It is integral to the project's frontend architecture, handling the UI and state management. The project's reliance on Vue is evident from the numerous imports and usage in the codebase, making it a critical component for the application's functionality.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Vue is deeply integrated into the project, with its usage spanning across components, views, and even the router configuration. The project leverages Vue's ecosystem, including Vue Router and Vuex (via Pinia), indicating a high level of integration. Replacing Vue would require a significant overhaul of the project's architecture and codebase.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to Vue, such as React or Angular, migrating to another framework would be non-trivial due to the depth of Vue's integration in the project. The project also uses Vue-specific libraries and patterns, which would need to be replaced or adapted. The availability of alternatives does not mitigate the complexity and effort required for such a migration.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of Vue being abandoned is low, given its widespread adoption, active development, and strong community support. However, should Vue be abandoned, the project would face significant challenges, as it is heavily reliant on Vue for its frontend development. The impact would be direct and substantial, necessitating immediate action.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given Vue's critical role in the project's architecture, its deep integration, and the complexity of replacing it, the abandonment of Vue would be highly impactful. The project's frontend is built around Vue, and its loss would require a significant effort to migrate to an alternative framework. While the likelihood of Vue being abandoned is low, the potential impact justifies considering contingency plans.",
