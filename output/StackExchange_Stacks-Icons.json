    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency axios is used in the project to fetch SVG icons from Figma, which is a critical part of the build process. Without axios, the project cannot fetch and process the icons, which are essential for the project's functionality.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Axios is integrated into the project's build script, specifically in the `write-svg.ts` file, where it is used to make HTTP requests to the Figma API. The integration is deep as it directly affects the project's ability to fetch and process icons.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to axios, such as the Fetch API, node-fetch, or got. However, switching to an alternative would require changes to the build script and potentially other parts of the project. The availability of alternatives does not significantly reduce the difficulty of replacement due to the specific usage patterns and configurations of axios in the project.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on axios's abandonment is low. Axios is a widely used and maintained library, and there is no immediate indication that it will be abandoned. However, the possibility cannot be entirely ruled out, especially if the maintainers decide to deprecate the library in favor of native solutions like the Fetch API.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role of axios in fetching and processing icons for the project, its abandonment would likely be directly impactful. The project relies on axios for a key part of its build process, and finding a suitable replacement would require significant effort. Therefore, the abandonment of axios would be impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @stackoverflow/eslint-config dependency is used for linting the project's JavaScript/TypeScript code. Linting is crucial for maintaining code quality and consistency, especially in a project that is likely to be used by many developers. However, the core functionality of the Stacks-Icons project is not directly dependent on linting. The project could still function and deliver its main value (providing icons) even if the linting configuration were to change or be removed. Therefore, while important for code quality, the dependency is not critical to the project's primary functionality.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @stackoverflow/eslint-config dependency is integrated into the project through the eslintConfig field in the package.json file. This is a standard and straightforward way to configure ESLint in a project. Replacing or removing this configuration would require minimal changes to the project's codebase, primarily limited to the package.json file and possibly some configuration files. There is no deep integration of this dependency into the project's core code or functionality.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are numerous alternative ESLint configurations available, including the default ESLint configurations, community-shared configurations, and custom configurations. The @stackoverflow/eslint-config is tailored to Stack Overflow's coding standards, but similar configurations can be found or created to match these standards. The availability of alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace this dependency if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. ESLint configurations are generally stable and do not frequently undergo breaking changes that would necessitate immediate action. Additionally, the project could continue to use an older version of the configuration or switch to an alternative without significant disruption.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, the abandonment of the @stackoverflow/eslint-config dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the Stacks-Icons project. The dependency is important for maintaining code quality but is not critical to the project's core functionality. It is minimally integrated into the project, and there are readily available alternatives. The likelihood of external changes forcing action on this dependency is low. Therefore, the dependency's abandonment would not be impactful.",

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The tslib dependency is crucial for TypeScript projects that use the `--importHelpers` flag, as it provides essential helper functions that reduce code duplication and improve performance. Given that the project is a TypeScript project and likely uses these helper functions, tslib's functionality is highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "tslib is integrated at a fundamental level in TypeScript projects that use the `--importHelpers` flag. Replacing it would require significant changes to the project's TypeScript configuration and potentially the codebase itself, making the integration depth quite high.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to tslib, such as manually including the helper functions or using other libraries that provide similar functionality, these alternatives may not offer the same level of optimization and ease of use. The availability of suitable alternatives is limited, making replacement somewhat difficult.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on tslib's abandonment is low. TypeScript and its ecosystem are stable, and tslib is maintained by Microsoft, which reduces the risk of abandonment. However, the possibility cannot be entirely ruled out.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the high importance of tslib's functionality to the project and the depth of its integration, its abandonment would be impactful. However, the low likelihood of abandonment and the availability of some alternatives mitigate this impact. Overall, the abandonment of tslib would likely be directly impactful to the project.",
