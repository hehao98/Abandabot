    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Axios is used as the HTTP client for making requests to the Fastly API. It is initialized with specific configurations such as baseURL, timeout, and headers, indicating its critical role in the project's functionality. The project relies on Axios for all HTTP communications, making it a core dependency.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Axios is deeply integrated into the project, as evidenced by its initialization with specific configurations and its use throughout the project for making HTTP requests. The project creates two instances of Axios with different configurations, indicating a significant level of integration.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternative HTTP clients available (e.g., fetch, node-fetch, got), Axios is widely used and offers a comprehensive feature set, including request and response interceptors, automatic transforms for JSON data, and support for both browser and Node.js environments. Replacing Axios would require significant effort to ensure compatibility and maintain functionality.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Axios's abandonment is low. Axios is a mature and widely adopted library with a large community and active maintenance. However, the possibility cannot be entirely ruled out, especially if a critical security issue is discovered or if the maintainers decide to discontinue the project.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given Axios's critical role in the project as the primary HTTP client, its deep integration, and the effort required to replace it, the abandonment of Axios would likely be directly impactful to the project. The project would need to find a suitable replacement and refactor the codebase to accommodate the new HTTP client, which could introduce risks and require significant development effort.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The eslint-plugin-import is a development dependency used for linting ES2015+ import/export syntax. While it is important for maintaining code quality and preventing issues with misspelling of file paths and import names, it is not directly involved in the core functionality of the project. Therefore, its importance to the project is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of eslint-plugin-import in the project is through the ESLint configuration file (.eslintrc). It is used as a plugin in the ESLint setup, which is a common practice for JavaScript projects. Replacing it would require updating the ESLint configuration, which is a straightforward task. Therefore, the depth of its integration in the project's code base is low.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available that could serve as suitable replacements for eslint-plugin-import, such as eslint-plugin-node, eslint-plugin-promise, and others. These alternatives also provide linting capabilities for ES2015+ import/export syntax. Therefore, the availability of alternative packages is high.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. ESLint and its plugins are widely used in the JavaScript ecosystem, and there is a strong community support for maintaining these tools. Additionally, the project could continue using the current version of eslint-plugin-import even if it becomes abandoned, as long as it meets the project's needs.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of eslint-plugin-import to the project, the low depth of its integration, the high availability of alternative packages, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of eslint-plugin-import would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

      "reasoning": "Mocha is used as the test runner in the project, as indicated by the 'test' script in the package.json. Testing is a critical part of the development process, ensuring code quality and functionality. However, the importance of Mocha specifically is moderate because while testing is crucial, Mocha is just one of many test runners available for Node.js projects.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Mocha is integrated into the project through the 'test' script in the package.json. This is a relatively shallow integration, as it is only used for running tests and does not deeply intertwine with the core functionality of the project. Replacing Mocha would primarily involve updating the 'test' script and possibly some test files, but it would not require extensive changes to the project's main codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Mocha available for Node.js projects, such as Jest, Jasmine, and Ava. These alternatives offer similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace Mocha if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Mocha's abandonment is low. Mocha is a well-established and widely used test runner, and while it could potentially be abandoned, the presence of active alternatives and the relatively shallow integration of Mocha in the project reduce the risk of being forced to act on its abandonment.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of Mocha to the project, its shallow integration, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of being forced to act on its abandonment, the abandonment of Mocha would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",
