    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @krakenjs/jsx-pragmatic dependency is used for rendering JSX templates in various environments (HTML, DOM, React, Preact) without tying the project to a specific framework. Given the project's reliance on JSX for component rendering and the flexibility provided by jsx-pragmatic, its functionality is crucial for maintaining the project's rendering capabilities across different environments.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project through multiple flow-typed definitions and is likely used in various parts of the codebase for rendering components. However, the exact depth of integration is not fully detailed in the provided context. Given its role in rendering, it's likely moderately integrated, but not to the extent that it would be extremely difficult to replace.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @krakenjs/jsx-pragmatic, such as Babel's JSX pragma option, which allows for custom JSX transformations. Additionally, other libraries like React's own JSX transformation could potentially serve as replacements, though they might not offer the same level of flexibility across different rendering environments. The availability of alternatives makes it somewhat easier to replace, but the specific features of jsx-pragmatic might not be fully replicated.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. Changes in JSX standards or the emergence of new, more efficient rendering libraries could make jsx-pragmatic obsolete. However, given its current utility and the project's specific needs, such changes are not immediately foreseeable.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @krakenjs/jsx-pragmatic to the project's rendering capabilities, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would likely be impactful to the project. The project relies on its flexibility for rendering across different environments, and while alternatives exist, they may not fully meet the project's needs without significant adjustments.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @krakenjs/beaver-logger dependency is used for logging in the paypal-sdk-client project. Logging is crucial for monitoring and debugging, especially in a complex SDK like PayPal's. The dependency provides functionality for buffering and sending logs to the server, which is essential for understanding the SDK's behavior in production. Given its role in maintaining the health and observability of the SDK, the functionality provided by beaver-logger is highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @krakenjs/beaver-logger in the paypal-sdk-client project appears to be minimal, with only a few lines of code directly interacting with it. The dependency is used in a single file (src/logger.js) for logging purposes. This suggests that while the dependency is important for logging, its integration into the project's codebase is not deeply entrenched, making it relatively easier to replace if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative logging libraries available in the JavaScript ecosystem, such as Winston, Bunyan, and Pino, which could potentially serve as replacements for @krakenjs/beaver-logger. These alternatives offer similar or even enhanced functionality, including structured logging, various transport options, and performance optimizations. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace beaver-logger, provided that the project's logging requirements can be met by one of these libraries.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is relatively low. Logging libraries, including beaver-logger, tend to be stable and do not frequently undergo breaking changes that would necessitate immediate action. Additionally, the project's minimal integration with beaver-logger reduces the risk of being significantly impacted by its abandonment. However, if the dependency were to become abandoned, the project would eventually need to consider alternatives to ensure continued support and maintenance of its logging functionality.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of logging in the paypal-sdk-client project, the @krakenjs/beaver-logger dependency plays a crucial role in maintaining the SDK's observability and debuggability. However, its relatively shallow integration and the availability of alternative logging libraries mitigate the potential impact of its abandonment. While the dependency's abandonment would not likely be directly impactful in the short term, the project would need to evaluate and potentially migrate to an alternative logging solution to ensure long-term maintainability and support.",

      "reasoning": "The jsonwebtoken dependency is used in the project to decode and verify JWT tokens, which is crucial for handling authentication and secure communication. The project uses it to decode customer IDs from SDK tokens, indicating its role in core functionality related to user authentication and data security.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project's test suite, specifically in the script.test.js file, where it is used to mock and verify JWT tokens. While it is not deeply integrated into the main application code, its use in testing indicates a level of integration that would require updates to test cases if replaced.",

    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to jsonwebtoken, such as jose, njwt, and others, which provide similar functionality for handling JWTs. These alternatives are actively maintained and could serve as suitable replacements, reducing the difficulty of switching away from jsonwebtoken.",
      "score": 2

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the dependency's role in testing rather than in the core application logic, and the availability of alternatives, the likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. However, changes in JWT standards or security vulnerabilities could necessitate action.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the dependency's importance in testing and the availability of alternatives, the abandonment of jsonwebtoken would not likely be directly impactful to the project.
