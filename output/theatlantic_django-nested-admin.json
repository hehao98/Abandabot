    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @babel/core package is crucial for modern JavaScript development, especially in projects that use ES6+ features. It is used to transpile JavaScript code to be compatible with older browsers. Given that the project includes a build script and uses modern JavaScript features, @babel/core is likely essential for the project's build process.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "@babel/core is deeply integrated into the project's build and development process, as indicated by the presence of multiple Babel-related packages in the devDependencies and the use of Babel in the build script. Replacing it would require significant changes to the build configuration and potentially the codebase itself.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to Babel, such as TypeScript's compiler or other transpilers, they may not offer the same level of community support, plugin ecosystem, or compatibility features. Switching to an alternative would require careful consideration and testing.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given Babel's central role in the JavaScript ecosystem and its widespread use, the likelihood of it being abandoned is low. However, if it were to be abandoned, the impact on the project would be significant due to its deep integration and importance.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @babel/core to the project's build process, its deep integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of @babel/core would be highly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The stylelint-prettier dependency is used to integrate Prettier with Stylelint, ensuring code formatting consistency. Given that the project includes a linting script that runs Stylelint on SCSS files, the functionality provided by stylelint-prettier is important for maintaining code quality and consistency. However, the direct impact on the core functionality of the django-nested-admin project is limited, as it primarily affects the development process rather than the runtime behavior of the application.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of stylelint-prettier in the project is straightforward, as it is only referenced in the .stylelintrc configuration file. This indicates a shallow level of integration, with no direct usage in the project's source code. Replacing or removing this dependency would primarily involve updating the linting configuration, which is a relatively simple task.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to stylelint-prettier for integrating Prettier with Stylelint, such as manually configuring Prettier and Stylelint to work together without a dedicated plugin. Additionally, other plugins or tools could be used to achieve similar code formatting goals. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace stylelint-prettier if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the abandonment of stylelint-prettier is low. The dependency is used for code formatting during development, and its abandonment would not directly affect the runtime functionality of the application. The project could continue to use the current version of stylelint-prettier even if it were abandoned, or switch to an alternative solution without significant impact.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, the abandonment of stylelint-prettier would have a limited impact on the django-nested-admin project. Its role is primarily in the development process, ensuring code formatting consistency, and does not directly affect the application's core functionality. The shallow integration and availability of alternatives further reduce the potential impact. Therefore, the abandonment of this dependency is not likely to be directly impactful to the project.",

      "reasoning": "The postcss-scss dependency is used in the project to parse SCSS files for linting purposes. While it plays a role in the development process, its functionality is not critical to the core functionality of the django-nested-admin project. It is more of a convenience tool for ensuring code quality rather than a necessity for the application to run.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of postcss-scss in the project is minimal. It is only referenced in the .stylelintrc file to specify the custom syntax for SCSS files. This indicates a shallow integration that would not require extensive changes to the codebase if the dependency were to be replaced or removed.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives available for parsing SCSS files, such as sass, node-sass, and even the native CSS parser with some adjustments. These alternatives could serve as suitable replacements with minimal effort, as the primary use case is for linting rather than compilation.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The project's use of postcss-scss is limited to a development tool for linting, and changes in the broader ecosystem are unlikely to necessitate immediate action.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the minimal importance and integration of postcss-scss in the django-nested-admin project, along with the availability of alternatives and low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",
