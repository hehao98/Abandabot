      "reasoning": "The dependency 'react-scripts' is crucial for the project as it is used to start, build, and test the React application. It provides the necessary scripts and configurations for a React project, which are essential for the development and deployment process. Given its role in the project's lifecycle, its functionality is highly important.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The 'react-scripts' dependency is deeply integrated into the project's build and development process. It is used in multiple npm scripts for starting, building, and testing the application. Replacing it would require significant changes to the project's configuration and build process, making it difficult to replace.",

    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to 'react-scripts' such as 'Vite' or 'Parcel', they would require substantial changes to the project's configuration and build process. The availability of alternatives does not significantly reduce the difficulty of replacement due to the depth of integration of 'react-scripts' in the project.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the React ecosystem is stable, changes in the ecosystem or security vulnerabilities could necessitate a replacement. However, such changes are not highly frequent.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of 'react-scripts' to the project's development and build process, its deep integration, the difficulty of finding and integrating suitable alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of 'react-scripts' would likely be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The unleash-proxy-client is used for managing feature toggles in the Hathor Wallet project. Feature toggles are crucial for enabling or disabling features dynamically without deploying new code. Given the project's nature as a wallet, feature toggles can be essential for rolling out new features or disabling problematic ones quickly. However, the direct impact on the core functionality of the wallet (transactions, security) is limited.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The unleash-proxy-client is integrated into the project's saga for feature toggles, indicating a moderate level of integration. It is used for fetching toggles and updating the context, but the core functionality of the wallet does not heavily depend on it. The integration is manageable, and replacing it would require changes to the feature toggle management logic but not to the core wallet functionality.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to unleash-proxy-client for feature toggle management, such as LaunchDarkly, Split, and ConfigCat. These alternatives provide similar or even more comprehensive feature toggle management capabilities. The availability of suitable alternatives makes it less difficult to replace unleash-proxy-client if needed.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. Feature toggle management is a common need, and even if unleash-proxy-client were abandoned, the project could switch to an alternative without significant disruption. The project's core functionality does not depend on this dependency, reducing the likelihood of being forced to act.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance, integration, availability of alternatives, and likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of unleash-proxy-client would not likely be directly impactful to the Hathor Wallet project. The project could switch to an alternative feature toggle management solution with manageable effort, and the core functionality of the wallet would remain unaffected.",

      "reasoning": "jQuery is used extensively throughout the project for modal management, including showing, hiding, and event handling for modals. This functionality is crucial for the user interface and user experience of the Hathor Wallet, as modals are a primary way users interact with the application. Given its widespread use and importance in the UI, the functionality provided by jQuery is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "jQuery is deeply integrated into the project, with its methods being called directly in numerous components for modal management. The project relies on jQuery for modal lifecycle events, such as showing, hiding, and handling events like 'hidden.bs.modal'. This deep integration suggests that replacing jQuery would require significant refactoring of the codebase, affecting many components and their modal management logic.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling, such as vanilla JavaScript, React's built-in capabilities, or other lightweight libraries like Zepto. However, given the project's current architecture and the specific use of jQuery for Bootstrap modal management, finding a suitable replacement that integrates as seamlessly and provides the same level of functionality could be challenging. The availability of alternatives does not necessarily mean they can be easily integrated without substantial changes.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on jQuery's abandonment is moderate. While jQuery's usage has declined with the rise of modern JavaScript frameworks and vanilla JavaScript capabilities, it remains a stable and widely used library. However, the trend towards modern frameworks and the potential for jQuery to become less maintained could eventually necessitate a move away from jQuery.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given jQuery's deep integration and crucial role in modal management within the Hathor Wallet project, its abandonment would likely be directly impactful. The project relies heavily on jQuery for a significant portion of its user interface logic, and replacing it would require extensive refactoring. While there are alternatives available, the effort and risk involved in switching to a different solution would be substantial. Therefore, the abandonment of jQuery would be impactful to the project.",
