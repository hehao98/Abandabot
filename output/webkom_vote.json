    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Cypress is used for frontend testing in the project, as indicated by the package.json scripts and the README.md. Testing is crucial for ensuring the reliability and stability of the application, especially for a voting system where accuracy and security are paramount. The project specifically uses Cypress for end-to-end (E2E) testing, which is essential for verifying the application's behavior from the user's perspective.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Cypress is integrated into the project's CI/CD pipeline, as seen in the .drone.yml file, and is used for both headless and GUI testing. The project has custom commands and configurations for Cypress, indicating a moderate level of integration. However, the integration is primarily focused on testing, which, while important, does not deeply intertwine with the core application logic.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Cypress for E2E testing, such as Selenium, Playwright, and TestCafe. These alternatives offer similar functionalities and could potentially replace Cypress with some adjustments to the testing scripts and configurations. The availability of these alternatives makes it feasible to replace Cypress, though it would require effort to migrate and adapt the existing test suites.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Cypress's abandonment is low. Cypress is a widely used and actively maintained project, and there is no immediate indication of it becoming abandoned. However, the dynamic nature of the JavaScript ecosystem means that dependencies can sometimes become deprecated or abandoned, so it's not impossible.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the importance of Cypress for frontend testing in the project, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of Cypress would be impactful but not critically so. The project could transition to an alternative testing framework with some effort, ensuring that the application's testing needs are still met.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency 'promptly' is used in the project to handle user input in the command line interface, specifically for creating users with different roles and setting passwords. While this functionality is important for the initial setup and administration of the project, it is not a core feature that affects the main voting functionality. Therefore, its importance to the project is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of 'promptly' in the project is limited to a single file (bin/users.ts) where it is used for prompting user input. The usage is straightforward and does not involve complex logic or deep integration with other parts of the codebase. Replacing 'promptly' would require changes to this file but would not significantly impact the overall project structure.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available for handling command line input in Node.js, such as 'inquirer', 'enquirer', and 'prompts'. These alternatives offer similar or even more advanced features compared to 'promptly'. Given the availability of suitable replacements, the difficulty of replacing 'promptly' is low.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. 'promptly' is a utility library with a stable API, and its functionality is not likely to be affected by changes in the Node.js ecosystem or other external factors. Additionally, the project's usage of 'promptly' is minimal and not critical to its core functionality.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of 'promptly' to the project, its limited integration, the availability of alternative packages, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of 'promptly' would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could easily switch to an alternative package with minimal effort.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The css-loader is a crucial dependency for the project as it is used to interpret @import and url() in CSS files, which is essential for the project's frontend development. The project's package.json shows that css-loader is listed as a dependency, indicating its importance in the build process.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The css-loader is integrated into the project's build process, as indicated by its presence in the package.json file. However, the depth of its integration is not explicitly detailed in the provided context. Given that it's a loader for webpack, it's likely used in the webpack configuration to process CSS files, but without the specific webpack configuration file, it's hard to assess the depth of integration.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to css-loader, such as style-loader, mini-css-extract-plugin, and others that can handle CSS in webpack. However, css-loader is specifically designed to interpret @import and url() in CSS files, and its alternatives might not provide the exact same functionality or might require additional configuration. The availability of alternatives suggests that replacing css-loader is feasible, but it might require adjustments to the project's build process.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. CSS processing is a fundamental part of web development, and css-loader is a well-established package with a large user base. However, changes in webpack or CSS standards could potentially impact the need for css-loader, but such changes are not imminent.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of css-loader in processing CSS files for the project, its integration into the build process, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of css-loader would be impactful to the project. The project relies on css-loader for its frontend development, and finding a suitable replacement would require effort and adjustments to the build process.",
