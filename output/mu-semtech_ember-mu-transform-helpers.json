    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The `ember-source` package is crucial for any Ember.js project as it provides the core functionality of the Ember framework. The project `ember-mu-transform-helpers` is an Ember addon, which means it directly depends on Ember's core functionalities to provide its features. Without `ember-source`, the addon cannot function, making it highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of `ember-source` in the project is deep, as it is a fundamental dependency for any Ember.js project. The project's compatibility and functionality are directly tied to the version of `ember-source` it uses. The `config/ember-try.js` file shows multiple scenarios testing the project with different versions of `ember-source`, indicating its critical role in the project's development and testing environments.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are no direct alternatives to `ember-source` for an Ember.js project. While other JavaScript frameworks exist, migrating to a different framework would require a complete rewrite of the project, which is not feasible. Therefore, replacing `ember-source` is extremely difficult due to the lack of suitable alternatives that provide the same functionality.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of `ember-source` being abandoned is low, given its central role in the Ember.js ecosystem and the active maintenance by the Ember.js core team. However, if it were to be abandoned, the impact on the project would be significant, as the project cannot function without it.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical importance of `ember-source` to the functionality of the `ember-mu-transform-helpers` project, its deep integration, the lack of viable alternatives, and the significant impact its abandonment would have, it is clear that the abandonment of `ember-source` would be highly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency ember-cli-sri is used to generate Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes for Ember applications, which is a security feature to ensure that JavaScript and stylesheets are loaded with the correct content when using a CDN. Given the security implications, the functionality provided by ember-cli-sri is important for projects that rely on CDNs for asset delivery. However, the project ember-mu-transform-helpers does not explicitly mention the use of CDNs or the need for SRI in its README, suggesting that the dependency might not be critical to its core functionality.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of ember-cli-sri in the project appears to be minimal, as it is listed as a devDependency in the package.json file. This suggests that it is used during the build process rather than being deeply integrated into the application's runtime code. The lack of specific code snippets or detailed usage in the project's README further supports the notion that its integration is not extensive.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative packages and methods available for implementing Subresource Integrity in web applications, such as manually adding SRI hashes or using other build tools that support SRI. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easier to replace ember-cli-sri if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The project does not seem to heavily rely on ember-cli-sri for its core functionality, and the security feature it provides, while important, can be implemented through other means if needed.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, the abandonment of ember-cli-sri would not likely be directly impactful to the project ember-mu-transform-helpers. The dependency provides a security feature that, while valuable, is not critical to the project's core functionality. Additionally, the dependency is not deeply integrated into the project, and there are viable alternatives available. Therefore, the project could continue to function effectively without ember-cli-sri, albeit with a potential reduction in security for CDN-delivered assets.",

      "reasoning": "The ember-qunit dependency is used for testing in the project. Testing is a critical part of software development, ensuring that the code works as expected and helps in identifying bugs early. However, the core functionality of the project, which is to provide transform helpers for a mu.semte.ch backend, does not directly depend on ember-qunit. The dependency is more about the development process rather than the runtime functionality of the project.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The ember-qunit dependency is integrated into the project's test files, as seen in the provided code snippets. It is used for setting up and running unit tests. While it is used across multiple test files, its integration is limited to the testing environment and does not deeply affect the main application code. Replacing it would require updating the test setup and possibly the test files, but it would not impact the core application logic.",

    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternatives to ember-qunit for testing Ember applications, such as ember-mocha. These alternatives provide similar functionalities for setting up and running tests. The availability of these alternatives makes it feasible to replace ember-qunit if necessary, although it would require some effort to migrate the test suite to use a different testing framework.",

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The Ember ecosystem is stable, and ember-qunit is a well-maintained project. However, if the Ember community were to shift towards a different testing framework or if ember-qunit were to become deprecated, the project might need to consider alternatives.",
