      "reasoning": "The @angular-devkit/build-angular package is crucial for building, serving, and testing Angular applications. It provides the necessary tooling for Angular CLI commands such as `ng build`, `ng serve`, and `ng test`. Given that ng-matero is an Angular admin template, the build and serve functionalities are essential for development and deployment processes. Therefore, the functionality provided by this dependency is highly important to the project.",

      "reasoning": "The @angular-devkit/build-angular package is deeply integrated into the project's configuration files, such as angular.json and karma.conf.js. It is used for building, serving, and testing the application. Replacing this dependency would require significant changes to the project's configuration and build process, indicating a high level of integration.",

    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternative build tools and test runners available for Angular applications, such as Webpack directly or Jest for testing, replacing @angular-devkit/build-angular would require substantial effort. This includes reconfiguring the build and test processes and potentially rewriting parts of the codebase to be compatible with the new tools. The availability of alternatives does not significantly reduce the difficulty of replacement.",

      "reasoning": "Given the critical role of @angular-devkit/build-angular in Angular projects and its maintenance by the Angular team, the likelihood of its abandonment is low. However, if it were to be abandoned, the impact on the project would be significant due to the dependency's central role in the build and test processes.",

    "reasoning": "Considering the critical role of @angular-devkit/build-angular in the build, serve, and test processes of the ng-matero project, its abandonment would be highly impactful. The dependency is deeply integrated into the project's configuration and there are no straightforward alternatives that could be easily adopted. Therefore, the abandonment of this dependency would likely be directly impactful to the project.",

      "reasoning": "The angular-eslint dependency is used for linting Angular projects, ensuring code quality and consistency. While important for maintaining code standards, it is not directly involved in the core functionality of the ng-matero project, which is an Angular admin template. Therefore, its importance to the project's core functionality is moderate.",

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on angular-eslint's abandonment is low.

However, if angular-eslint were to be abandoned, the project might need to find an alternative linting solution.",

    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance and integration of angular-eslint in the ng-matero project, along with the availability of alternatives and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of angular-eslint would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could transition to an alternative linting solution with moderate effort.",

      "reasoning": "Stylelint is integrated into the project's build process through the 'lint:scss' script in package.json. While it is used for linting SCSS files, it is not deeply integrated into the core codebase.
