    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The bootstrap-datepicker is used for date selection in the project. Given the nature of the project, which involves trails related data manipulation and visualization, date selection is a crucial feature for scheduling, maintenance, and accessibility notifications. Therefore, the functionality provided by bootstrap-datepicker is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The bootstrap-datepicker is integrated into the project as a dependency listed in the package.json file. However, without specific code snippets showing its usage, it's challenging to assess the depth of its integration. Assuming it's used in multiple components for date selection, replacing it could require significant changes across the project.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative datepicker libraries available for Angular projects, such as ngx-bootstrap/datepicker and Angular Material's datepicker. These alternatives could provide similar functionality, making it feasible to replace bootstrap-datepicker if necessary.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the dependency is actively maintained and widely used, changes in the Angular ecosystem or security vulnerabilities could necessitate a replacement.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of date selection functionality to the project, the moderate difficulty of replacing the dependency due to its integration, the availability of alternative packages, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of bootstrap-datepicker would likely be impactful to the project.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency @types/jasmine is used for type definitions in Jasmine testing framework. While testing is crucial for maintaining code quality, the direct impact on the application's functionality is minimal. The project can still function without these type definitions, albeit with potential issues in type checking during development.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "@types/jasmine is integrated into the project as a devDependency, primarily used for type checking in tests. Its integration depth is limited to the testing environment and does not affect the main application code directly. Replacing or removing it would primarily impact the development and testing process, not the application's runtime.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @types/jasmine for type definitions in testing frameworks, such as @types/mocha or @types/jest. These alternatives can provide similar functionality, making it relatively easy to replace @types/jasmine if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the abandonment of @types/jasmine is low. Type definitions for testing frameworks are generally stable, and even if @types/jasmine were abandoned, the project could continue using the existing version or switch to an alternative without significant disruption.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, the abandonment of @types/jasmine would have a minimal impact on the project. It is a devDependency used for type checking in tests, and there are viable alternatives available. The project's core functionality would remain unaffected, and the development process could adapt with relative ease.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Protractor is used for end-to-end testing in the project, which is crucial for ensuring the application behaves as expected in a real browser environment. However, the project's README and package.json do not indicate that end-to-end testing is a core part of the development or deployment process. The usage of Protractor is limited to the e2e testing scripts, which suggests its functionality, while important for quality assurance, is not directly tied to the application's core features or user-facing functionality.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Protractor is integrated into the project's e2e testing setup, as evidenced by its presence in the e2e directory and angular.json configuration. However, its integration is confined to the testing phase and does not deeply intertwine with the main application code. The project could potentially switch to another end-to-end testing framework without significant changes to the core application logic.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Protractor for end-to-end testing in Angular applications, such as Cypress and TestCafe. These alternatives offer similar functionalities and are actively maintained, making them suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacing Protractor in the project.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Protractor's abandonment is moderate. While Protractor is a popular tool for Angular applications, the Angular team has announced plans to deprecate Protractor in favor of other testing tools. This announcement increases the likelihood that the project may need to consider alternatives in the future.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, Protractor's abandonment would have a moderate impact on the project. While it plays a crucial role in end-to-end testing, its integration is not deeply embedded in the core application, and there are viable alternatives available. The announcement of its deprecation by the Angular team further supports the need to consider alternatives, but the transition is manageable without immediate urgency.",
