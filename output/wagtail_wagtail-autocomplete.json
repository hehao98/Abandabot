    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "@babel/core is a critical tool for modern JavaScript development, enabling the use of next-generation JavaScript features by transpiling them into a version compatible with current environments. Given that the project, wagtail-autocomplete, is a JavaScript library, the functionality provided by @babel/core is essential for ensuring the library can be used across different environments and browsers. The project's package.json shows a heavy reliance on Babel for both development and build processes, indicating its importance.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @babel/core in the project is deep, as evidenced by the extensive list of Babel plugins and presets in the devDependencies section of the package.json. These plugins and presets are used to enable specific JavaScript features and optimizations, suggesting that @babel/core is woven into the project's build and development processes. Replacing it would require not just finding an alternative transpiler but also ensuring compatibility with all these plugins and presets, which could be challenging.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to @babel/core, such as TypeScript's tsc or other transpilers like Traceur, the ecosystem and plugin support for Babel are unparalleled. The project's reliance on specific Babel plugins for features like class properties, decorators, and more, means that finding a suitable alternative that supports all these features out of the box or with minimal configuration would be difficult. This makes the availability of suitable alternatives limited.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on @babel/core's abandonment is moderate. While Babel is a cornerstone of the JavaScript ecosystem, the emergence of new JavaScript standards and browser capabilities could reduce the need for transpilation in the future. However, given the current state of JavaScript development and the project's specific needs, such a scenario is not imminent but possible in the long term.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the critical role @babel/core plays in the project's development and build processes, its deep integration, the limited availability of suitable alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @babel/core would likely be directly impactful to the project. The project would face significant challenges in maintaining its build process and ensuring compatibility across environments without @babel/core.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @babel/plugin-proposal-decorators is a development dependency used in the project. It is part of the Babel ecosystem, which is crucial for transforming JavaScript code to be compatible with different environments. However, the specific plugin for decorators is not a core functionality of the project but rather a tool that aids in the development process. Its importance is moderate because while it supports the development workflow, the project could potentially function without it by using alternative approaches or plugins.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration depth of @babel/plugin-proposal-decorators in the project is relatively shallow. It is listed among many other Babel plugins in the devDependencies section of the package.json file, indicating that it is used for specific features or syntax transformations rather than being deeply embedded in the project's core logic. Replacing it would require adjustments in the Babel configuration but would not necessitate extensive changes across the codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @babel/plugin-proposal-decorators, including other Babel plugins or even different approaches to achieve similar functionality without using decorators. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace the dependency. However, the choice of alternative would depend on the specific needs and compatibility with the rest of the project's toolchain.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The Babel ecosystem is widely used and supported, and while individual plugins may become deprecated or abandoned, the core Babel tooling is likely to continue receiving support. Additionally, the project could switch to alternative plugins or approaches if necessary.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, the abandonment of @babel/plugin-proposal-decorators would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The dependency is important for the development workflow but not critical to the project's core functionality. Its integration is not deeply embedded, and there are viable alternatives available. Furthermore, the likelihood of external changes forcing action on this dependency is low. Therefore, the impact of its abandonment would be minimal.",

    "integration": {

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the widespread use of cookies in web applications and the availability of alternative packages, it is unlikely that external environmental changes will force the project to act on the dependency's abandonment. The project can continue to use js-cookie or switch to an alternative without significant impact.",
