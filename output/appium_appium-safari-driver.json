      "reasoning": "The lodash library is used in multiple parts of the appium-safari-driver project, including utility functions and command handling. It provides essential utility functions like `_.toPairs`, `_.has`, `_.isEmpty`, and `_.trim`, which are used for handling capabilities, processing command outputs, and managing data structures. These functions are crucial for the correct operation of the driver, especially in handling Safari-specific capabilities and command execution.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Lodash is integrated into several key components of the project, including utility functions and command handling. It is used in the `formatCapsForServer` function to process capabilities and in the `uploadRecordedMedia` function to handle media upload options. The integration is deep enough that replacing lodash would require significant refactoring of these components to ensure they continue to function correctly without lodash's utility functions.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to lodash, such as native JavaScript methods, Ramda, or custom utility functions. However, replacing lodash would require careful consideration of the specific utility functions used in the project and ensuring that the alternatives provide the same functionality and performance. While alternatives exist, the effort to replace lodash and ensure compatibility with the existing codebase would be non-trivial.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on lodash's abandonment is moderate. While lodash is a widely used library with a large community, the JavaScript ecosystem is dynamic, and changes in browser support or Node.js versions could potentially impact the library's utility. However, given lodash's stability and widespread use, such changes are not highly likely in the near term.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of lodash's utility functions to the appium-safari-driver project, the depth of its integration, the availability of alternatives, and the likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of lodash would be impactful but not critically so. The project would need to invest effort in replacing lodash, but the impact would be manageable with careful planning and execution.",

      "reasoning": "The @semantic-release/git plugin is used to commit release assets to the project's git repository. While this functionality is useful for maintaining a clean and up-to-date repository, it is not critical to the core functionality of the appium-safari-driver, which is to automate Safari on macOS and iOS. The plugin's role is more about project management and less about the driver's primary purpose.",

It is used to commit specific files (docs, package.json, CHANGELOG.md) during the release process. While this integration is straightforward, it is not deeply embedded into the core codebase of the appium-safari-driver. Replacing or removing this plugin would require adjustments to the release process but would not affect the driver's core functionality.",

The @semantic-release/git plugin is not directly tied to the core functionality of the appium-safari-driver, and its abandonment would not immediately impact the driver's ability to automate Safari. However, changes in the semantic-release ecosystem or git itself could indirectly affect the plugin's utility.",

The plugin's role is more about project management and less about the driver's core functionality.
