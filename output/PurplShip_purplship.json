    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency 'turbo' is used in the project's build and development scripts, as seen in the package.json file. It is essential for running tasks like 'build', 'dev', and 'lint' across the project's workspaces. Given its role in the project's build and development process, it is highly important for maintaining the project's workflow and ensuring that the project can be built and developed efficiently.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Turbo is integrated into the project's build and development scripts, and it is used across multiple workspaces within the project. The presence of turbo-specific configuration files (e.g., turbo.json) in various parts of the project indicates a deep integration. Replacing turbo would require significant changes to the project's build and development process, affecting multiple workspaces and scripts.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are other task runners and build tools available (e.g., npm scripts, webpack, vite), turbo is specifically designed for monorepos and offers features that are beneficial for projects with multiple workspaces. Finding an alternative that provides the same level of efficiency and features for monorepos could be challenging. However, with some effort, it is possible to migrate to another tool, though it may not offer the same benefits as turbo.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on turbo's abandonment is relatively low. Turbo is a build tool, and its abandonment would not directly affect the project's functionality or its interaction with external systems. However, if turbo were to be abandoned, the project might need to consider migrating to another build tool to ensure long-term maintainability.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of turbo in the project's build and development process, its deep integration across multiple workspaces, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of turbo would be impactful to the project. It would require significant effort to replace and could affect the project's development workflow.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @rollup/plugin-json is used to convert .json files to ES6 modules, which is a common requirement in modern JavaScript projects. However, the functionality it provides is not unique and can be replicated with other tools or custom code. Given the project's focus on shipping integration and the lack of specific mention of JSON handling in the project's README, the functionality provided by this dependency is of moderate importance.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @rollup/plugin-json is listed as a devDependency in the package.json file, indicating it is used during the build process rather than in the runtime code. This suggests a relatively shallow integration into the project's codebase. Replacing it would likely require changes to the build configuration but not extensive modifications to the core application logic.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @rollup/plugin-json for converting JSON files to ES6 modules, including custom solutions and other plugins. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace the dependency if necessary.",

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The functionality provided by @rollup/plugin-json is stable and well-established, and there are no immediate signs of changes in the JavaScript ecosystem that would necessitate a replacement.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of the functionality provided by @rollup/plugin-json, its shallow integration into the project, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

It plays a crucial role in maintaining code quality and consistency, which is essential for a project like Karrio that involves complex shipping integrations. The presence of ESLint in the project's development dependencies and its usage in various configuration files underscore its importance.",

      "reasoning": "ESLint is integrated into the project through multiple configuration files and scripts. It is used in the build and linting processes, indicating a deep integration. Replacing ESLint would require updating these configurations and potentially altering the build and linting workflows, which could be complex and time-consuming.",

      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to ESLint, such as Prettier, JSHint, and TSLint, which could potentially serve as replacements. However, each of these tools has its own set of features and configurations, and switching to an alternative would require significant effort to achieve the same level of code quality and consistency that ESLint provides.",

      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on ESLint's abandonment is relatively low. ESLint is a widely used and actively maintained tool with a large community and corporate backing. However, the open-source nature of the project means that there is always a risk of abandonment, though it is not imminent.",
