    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The react-intl dependency is used extensively throughout the project for internationalization (i18n) purposes. It is crucial for providing localized messages and formatting in the user interface. Given the project's global user base, the functionality provided by react-intl is highly important for ensuring a user-friendly experience across different languages and regions.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "react-intl is deeply integrated into the project, as evidenced by its usage in numerous components and utility functions across the codebase. It is used for defining messages, formatting dates, numbers, and handling translations. The dependency is tightly coupled with the project's UI components, making it a core part of the application's internationalization strategy.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to react-intl, such as i18next and lingui, migrating to another library would require significant effort. This includes rewriting message definitions, updating component integrations, and ensuring compatibility with the existing i18n infrastructure. The availability of alternatives does not mitigate the complexity of replacing react-intl in this project.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on react-intl's abandonment is moderate. While the library is widely used and maintained, any significant changes in the JavaScript ecosystem or the library's maintenance status could necessitate action. However, given its current stability and community support, such a scenario is not immediately foreseeable.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role of react-intl in the project's internationalization strategy, its abandonment would have a significant impact. The dependency is deeply integrated into the codebase, and replacing it would require substantial effort. While there are alternatives available, the complexity of migration and the importance of i18n functionality make react-intl's abandonment highly impactful to the project.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/jest package provides TypeScript definitions for Jest, which is a widely used testing framework in JavaScript projects. Given that Daedalus includes Jest in its development dependencies and uses it for testing, the TypeScript definitions are crucial for ensuring type safety and developer productivity during the testing process. However, the direct impact on the project's core functionality is limited since it's a development tool rather than a runtime dependency.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @types/jest in the project is primarily through the TypeScript configuration and the use of Jest for testing. While it is used across various test files, its integration is not deeply embedded in the core application logic. Replacing or removing it would require updating TypeScript configurations and potentially some test files, but it does not affect the main application code.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative TypeScript definition packages for Jest, such as those provided by DefinitelyTyped, which could serve as suitable replacements. Additionally, Jest itself is evolving with better TypeScript support, potentially reducing the reliance on external type definitions. The availability of alternatives makes it less difficult to replace @types/jest.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is relatively low. Jest is a stable and widely supported testing framework, and its TypeScript definitions are maintained by the community. However, changes in TypeScript or Jest could potentially impact the relevance or necessity of @types/jest.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @types/jest for development and testing, its moderate integration in the project, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @types/jest would not likely be directly impactful to the project. It is a development tool that can be replaced or updated without affecting the core functionality of Daedalus.",

      "reasoning": "The @storybook/manager-webpack5 dependency is used in the development environment for managing and building Storybook stories. While it is important for the development process, it does not directly impact the core functionality of the Daedalus cryptocurrency wallet. Therefore, its importance to the project is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project's development scripts and is used for building and managing Storybook stories. However, it is not deeply integrated into the core codebase of the project. Replacing it would require updating the development scripts and possibly some configuration files, but it would not require extensive changes to the core functionality.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives available for managing and building Storybook stories, such as @storybook/manager-webpack4 and other Storybook managers. These alternatives could serve as suitable replacements and provide similar functionality. Therefore, replacing @storybook/manager-webpack5 would not be difficult considering the availability of alternative packages.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. Storybook managers are generally stable and well-maintained, and there is no immediate indication that @storybook/manager-webpack5 will be abandoned. However, if it were to be abandoned, the project could switch to an alternative Storybook manager with minimal impact.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance, integration, alternatives, and likelihood, the abandonment of @storybook/manager-webpack5 would not likely be directly impactful to the Daedalus project. The dependency is important for the development process but does not affect the core functionality of the wallet. There are suitable alternatives available, and the likelihood of external changes forcing action is low.",
