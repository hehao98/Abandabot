    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The webpack-cli is crucial for the build process of the SwiftFiddle project, as it is used to bundle and optimize the project's assets. The project's package.json shows that webpack-cli is used in both development and production scripts, indicating its importance in the project's workflow.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Webpack-cli is deeply integrated into the project's build process, as evidenced by its use in the 'prod' and 'dev' scripts in the package.json. Replacing it would require significant changes to the build configuration and potentially the project's structure.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to webpack-cli, such as Parcel or Rollup, migrating to these alternatives would require substantial effort. The project's current configuration and dependencies are tailored to webpack, making the transition non-trivial.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on webpack-cli's abandonment is moderate. While webpack is a widely used tool with a large community, the JavaScript ecosystem is fast-moving, and shifts in tooling preferences could impact its longevity.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role of webpack-cli in the project's build process, its deep integration, the effort required to replace it, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of webpack-cli would likely be directly impactful to the SwiftFiddle project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @fortawesome/pro-light-svg-icons dependency is used to provide specific light-weight icons for the SwiftFiddle project. Given the project's nature as an online playground for Swift, icons are likely used for UI elements to enhance user experience. However, the functionality provided by these icons, while useful, is not critical to the core functionality of the project, which is to run and share Swift code snippets. Therefore, the importance of this dependency is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is used in a single file (Public/js/icon.js) for importing specific icons. This suggests a shallow integration within the project's codebase. Replacing or removing this dependency would likely require minimal changes, primarily in the icon.js file where it is imported and used.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives available for icon libraries, including other FontAwesome packages (like @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons) and other icon libraries such as Material Icons or Feather Icons. These alternatives could provide similar or equivalent functionality, making the replacement of @fortawesome/pro-light-svg-icons relatively straightforward.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. Icon libraries are generally stable and changes in the external environment (such as new web standards or browser updates) are unlikely to directly impact the use of these icons.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of the dependency, its shallow integration in the project, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @fortawesome/pro-light-svg-icons would not likely be directly impactful to the SwiftFiddle project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The copy-webpack-plugin is used to copy static assets like images, favicons, and HTML files to the build directory. This functionality is crucial for the project as it ensures that all necessary static assets are available in the build directory for the application to function correctly. Without this plugin, the application would lack essential assets, leading to a broken user experience.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The plugin is integrated into the project's webpack configuration file (webpack.common.js) and is used to copy various static assets. The integration is straightforward, with clear patterns defined for what files to copy and where to place them. However, replacing it would require updating the webpack configuration to use a different method or plugin for copying these assets, which could be time-consuming but not overly complex.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to copy-webpack-plugin, such as file-loader, cpy-cli, and manual copying scripts. These alternatives can provide similar functionality, but they may require more configuration or additional scripts to achieve the same results. The availability of alternatives makes it less difficult to replace the plugin, but the transition would still require some effort.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The plugin is well-maintained and widely used in the webpack ecosystem. However, if the plugin were to be abandoned, the project would need to find an alternative solution for copying static assets, which could be prompted by security concerns or compatibility issues with newer versions of webpack.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the functionality provided by copy-webpack-plugin to the project, the moderate difficulty of replacing it due to its integration in the webpack configuration, the availability of alternative solutions, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would likely be impactful to the project. The project relies on this plugin for copying essential static assets, and finding and integrating an alternative would require significant effort.",
