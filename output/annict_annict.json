    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @rails/ujs dependency is used to handle unobtrusive JavaScript in Rails applications, which is crucial for handling AJAX requests and other JavaScript functionalities in a Rails project. Given that Annict is a Rails application, the functionality provided by @rails/ujs is essential for its operation, especially for handling forms and links without full page reloads.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @rails/ujs in the Annict project appears to be straightforward, with its usage primarily in the application.ts file for initializing the UJS functionality. However, since it's a core part of handling JavaScript in Rails applications, replacing it would require significant changes to how AJAX requests and other JavaScript functionalities are managed, indicating a deep integration.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternatives to @rails/ujs, such as using vanilla JavaScript or other libraries like Axios for AJAX requests. However, these alternatives would require rewriting significant portions of the application's JavaScript code to handle the same functionalities that @rails/ujs provides out of the box, making the replacement process complex.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given that @rails/ujs is a part of the Rails ecosystem, its abandonment is unlikely unless the Rails framework itself undergoes significant changes that deprecate its use. However, the Rails community is active and supportive, making it less likely for such a core component to be abandoned without alternatives or migration paths being provided.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @rails/ujs in handling unobtrusive JavaScript in Rails applications, its deep integration into the Annict project, the complexity of replacing it with alternatives, and the low likelihood of its abandonment, the abandonment of @rails/ujs would likely be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Prettier is used in the project to enforce a consistent code style, which is crucial for maintaining code quality and readability. However, its functionality, while important, is not directly tied to the core features of the project, such as anime tracking and sharing. Therefore, its importance is significant but not critical.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Prettier is integrated into the project's build process, specifically in the 'bin/check' script where it is run to format code. This indicates a moderate level of integration. However, it is not deeply embedded in the core logic or functionality of the project, making it relatively easier to replace or remove.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Prettier, such as ESLint (with formatting rules), StandardJS, and Beautify. These alternatives can provide similar code formatting capabilities. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace Prettier if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Prettier's abandonment is low. Prettier is widely used and supported, and its abandonment would likely be gradual, giving the project time to adapt. Additionally, the project's reliance on Prettier is not so critical that its abandonment would immediately impact the project's functionality.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, Prettier's abandonment would not likely be directly impactful to the project. Its functionality, while important for code quality, is not critical to the core features of the project. The availability of alternatives and the moderate level of integration further reduce the potential impact. Therefore, the project could continue to function effectively even if Prettier were to be abandoned.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The core-js library provides essential polyfills for ECMAScript features, which are crucial for ensuring compatibility across different JavaScript environments. Given that Annict is a web application that likely needs to support a wide range of browsers and devices, the functionality provided by core-js is highly important for maintaining consistent behavior and performance.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "core-js is integrated into the project as a direct dependency, as seen in the package.json file. However, without specific code snippets showing how core-js is used within the project, it's difficult to assess the depth of its integration. Given its role in polyfilling, it's likely used throughout the project to ensure compatibility, but the exact extent is unclear.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative polyfill libraries available, such as polyfill.io, which can provide similar functionality. However, core-js is one of the most comprehensive and widely used polyfill libraries, making it a preferred choice for many projects. Switching to an alternative would require careful consideration and testing to ensure compatibility and performance are not adversely affected.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on core-js's abandonment is moderate. As JavaScript evolves and browser support for newer features improves, the need for certain polyfills may decrease. However, given the current state of browser fragmentation and the need to support older browsers, core-js's functionality remains relevant.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of core-js for ensuring compatibility across different JavaScript environments, its integration into the project, the availability of alternatives, and the likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of core-js would likely be impactful to the Annict project. However, the impact could be mitigated by switching to an alternative polyfill library or by reducing the reliance on polyfills as browser support for newer JavaScript features improves.",
