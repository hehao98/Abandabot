    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The d3-tip dependency is used to provide tooltips for the radar visualization in the project. Tooltips are essential for enhancing user interaction and understanding of the data presented in the radar. Given the project's focus on generating an interactive radar, the functionality provided by d3-tip is crucial for the user experience.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "d3-tip is integrated into the project's codebase through multiple files, including stylesheets and JavaScript files responsible for rendering the radar and handling user interactions. The dependency is used in key components such as the radar graph and quadrant tables, indicating a deep integration. Replacing it would require significant changes to the codebase, including styles and event handling logic.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available for adding tooltips to D3.js visualizations, such as d3-tooltip and d3-svg-tip. These alternatives offer similar functionality and could potentially serve as suitable replacements. However, the ease of replacement would depend on the specific features used from d3-tip and the compatibility of these alternatives with the project's existing code.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While d3-tip is a popular library, the D3.js ecosystem is active, and there are ongoing developments in visualization libraries. However, as long as d3-tip continues to function as expected and no critical security issues are discovered, the immediate need to replace it may be low.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of tooltips to the project's user experience, the depth of d3-tip's integration, the availability of alternative packages, and the current stability of the D3.js ecosystem, the abandonment of d3-tip would likely be impactful to the project. The project would need to invest time and resources into finding and integrating a suitable replacement to maintain the radar's interactivity and user experience.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The project uses Sass for styling, which is a common practice in web development. However, the project's functionality is not heavily dependent on Sass. The main functionality of generating an interactive radar can be achieved with basic CSS. Therefore, while Sass enhances the development experience, it is not critical to the core functionality of the project.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Sass is integrated into the project through the use of `sass-loader` in the Webpack configuration files. This indicates that Sass is used for preprocessing CSS. The integration is straightforward and does not involve complex customizations or deep integration into the project's codebase. Replacing Sass with another CSS preprocessor or plain CSS would require changes to the Webpack configuration and possibly some refactoring of the stylesheets, but it is manageable.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Sass for CSS preprocessing, such as Less, Stylus, and PostCSS. These alternatives offer similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace Sass if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Sass's abandonment is low. Sass is a well-established tool with a large user base, and its abandonment would likely be gradual, giving the project time to adapt. Additionally, the project's use of Sass is not so specialized that it would be immediately impacted by such changes.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the analysis, the abandonment of Sass would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The functionality provided by Sass is important but not critical, the integration is manageable, there are suitable alternatives available, and the likelihood of being forced to act due to external changes is low. Therefore, the project can continue to use Sass without significant risk, but should be prepared to transition to an alternative if necessary.",
    "impactful": false

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The css-loader is crucial for handling CSS files in the project, enabling the use of CSS modules and interpreting @import and url() like import/require(). Given the project's reliance on CSS for styling the radar visualization, the functionality provided by css-loader is highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The css-loader is integrated into the project's Webpack configuration for both development and production builds. It is used in conjunction with other loaders like style-loader and postcss-loader, indicating a moderate level of integration. However, the project does not seem to heavily customize css-loader's behavior, suggesting that replacing it might not be extremely difficult.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to css-loader, such as style-loader, mini-css-extract-plugin, and others that can handle CSS in Webpack. These alternatives can provide similar functionality, making it relatively easy to replace css-loader if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on css-loader's abandonment is low. The project's dependencies are stable, and css-loader is a widely used package with a strong community. However, changes in Webpack or CSS standards could potentially impact this.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of css-loader to the project's CSS handling, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of css-loader would be impactful but not critically so. The project could transition to an alternative with some effort.",
