    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Axios is a widely-used HTTP client for making requests in both browser and Node.js environments. In the project, it is imported and set as a global variable in the bootstrap.js file, indicating its fundamental role in handling HTTP requests. Given its usage in setting default headers for all requests, it is clear that Axios is integral to the project's ability to communicate with external APIs or services.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Axios is integrated at a foundational level in the project, as evidenced by its import and configuration in the bootstrap.js file. It is set as a global variable and default headers are configured, suggesting that it is used throughout the project for making HTTP requests. This level of integration means that replacing Axios would require updating all instances where it is used for HTTP requests, which could be extensive depending on the project's size.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Axios, such as the Fetch API, SuperAgent, and Request (deprecated). However, Axios offers features like request and response interception, automatic JSON data transformation, and client-side XSRF protection, which may not be as straightforward to implement with alternatives. While alternatives exist, finding one that matches Axios's feature set and ease of use could be challenging.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Axios's abandonment is relatively low. Axios is a mature and widely adopted library with a large community and active maintenance. However, the JavaScript ecosystem is fast-moving, and unforeseen circumstances (e.g., a critical security issue) could necessitate a switch.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of Axios to the project's HTTP request handling, its deep integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of being forced to switch, the abandonment of Axios would be impactful but not critically so. The project would need to invest time in finding and integrating a suitable replacement, but the transition could be managed without immediate disruption to the project's functionality.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The share-api-polyfill provides a crucial functionality for enabling the Web Share API across different platforms, including desktop, which is essential for social sharing features in the project. Given the project's nature as a development skeleton for websites and apps, social sharing capabilities are likely important for user engagement and content dissemination.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is imported in a single file (resources/js/frontend-imports.js) and there is no evidence of deep integration or custom modifications in the project's codebase. This suggests that replacing the dependency would not require extensive changes to the project's code.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available that provide similar functionality for the Web Share API, such as 'web-share' and 'react-share'. These alternatives are actively maintained and could serve as suitable replacements with minimal adjustments to the project's code.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the Web Share API is becoming more widely supported, there is still a need for polyfills in certain environments. However, the project could potentially switch to native implementations or alternative polyfills if necessary.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the functionality provided by share-api-polyfill for social sharing features, its moderate integration depth, the availability of alternative packages, and the moderate likelihood of external environmental changes, the abandonment of this dependency would be somewhat impactful but not critically so. The project could adapt by switching to an alternative polyfill or native implementations with reasonable effort.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Bootstrap is a critical dependency for the project as it is extensively used in the frontend development. The project's SCSS files import a wide range of Bootstrap components, indicating a deep reliance on Bootstrap for styling and layout. The usage in views and configuration files further underscores its importance in the project's UI/UX design.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Bootstrap is deeply integrated into the project, with its components and utilities being directly imported and used in SCSS files. The project also uses Bootstrap's JavaScript components, as evidenced by the inclusion of Bootstrap's JS file in the Vite configuration. This deep integration makes replacing Bootstrap a significant task.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to Bootstrap, such as Tailwind CSS or Foundation, the project's current setup and the extensive use of Bootstrap-specific classes and components would require a substantial refactoring effort to switch to an alternative. The availability of alternatives does not mitigate the difficulty of replacing Bootstrap in this context.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given Bootstrap's widespread use and active maintenance, the likelihood of it being abandoned in the near future is low. However, the project's reliance on Bootstrap means that any significant changes or deprecations in Bootstrap could have a direct impact.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the deep integration and critical importance of Bootstrap in the project's frontend development, its abandonment would be highly impactful. The project would face significant challenges in replacing Bootstrap due to the extensive use of its components and the lack of a straightforward alternative that matches its feature set and integration level.",
