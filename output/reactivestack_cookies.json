      "reasoning": "The @rollup/plugin-typescript is used in multiple rollup configuration files across different packages within the project. It is essential for compiling TypeScript code into JavaScript, which is a core part of the build process. Given its widespread use and critical role in the build process, the functionality provided by this dependency is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the rollup configuration files of multiple packages, indicating a deep integration within the project's code base. Replacing it would require modifying multiple configuration files and potentially adjusting the build process for each package, which is a complex and time-consuming task.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative packages available for compiling TypeScript code with Rollup, such as @rollup/plugin-babel with @babel/preset-typescript. However, these alternatives may require significant changes to the build configuration and could introduce compatibility issues. The availability of alternatives does not make the replacement process straightforward.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the dependency's critical role in the build process and the lack of immediate alternatives that can be seamlessly integrated, it is unlikely that external environmental changes will force the project to act on the dependency's abandonment in the near future. However, the possibility cannot be entirely ruled out, especially if the dependency becomes unsupported or if significant security vulnerabilities are discovered.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the critical role of @rollup/plugin-typescript in the project's build process, its deep integration across multiple packages, and the complexity of replacing it with alternatives, the abandonment of this dependency would likely be directly impactful to the project. The project would face significant challenges in maintaining its build process and ensuring compatibility across packages if this dependency were to be abandoned.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Husky is used in the project to manage Git hooks, which is a common practice in JavaScript projects to ensure code quality and consistency. However, the core functionality of the project (handling cookies in React and other JavaScript environments) does not directly depend on Husky. Therefore, while Husky is useful for maintaining code quality, it is not critical to the project's main functionality.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Husky is integrated into the project through the 'prepare' script in the package.json file, which is a standard way to set up Git hooks. The integration is minimal and does not deeply affect the project's codebase. Replacing Husky would involve changing the Git hooks setup, which is a straightforward task.",

    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Husky for managing Git hooks, such as pre-commit, lint-staged, and simple npm scripts. These alternatives can provide similar functionality with minimal changes to the project setup. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace Husky if needed.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Husky's abandonment is low. Husky is a tool for development workflow rather than a core dependency that affects the project's runtime or deployment. Changes in the JavaScript ecosystem or project requirements are unlikely to necessitate immediate action on Husky's abandonment.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Given that Husky is not critical to the project's main functionality, is minimally integrated, has readily available alternatives, and is unlikely to be affected by external environmental changes, its abandonment would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",
