    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The `standard-version` package is used for automating the release process, including version bumping and CHANGELOG generation. This functionality is crucial for maintaining a consistent and automated CI/CD pipeline. Given its role in the release process, the functionality provided by `standard-version` is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "`standard-version` is integrated into the project's CI/CD process, as indicated by its use in the `release` script within `package.json`. However, its integration is limited to the release process and does not deeply affect the core functionality of the application. Replacing it would require adjustments to the release process but would not necessitate extensive changes to the codebase.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative packages available for versioning and CHANGELOG generation, such as `release-please`, which is recommended by the `standard-version` README itself. The availability of suitable alternatives makes it less difficult to replace `standard-version` if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given that `standard-version` is already deprecated and the project is aware of alternatives, there is a moderate likelihood that external environmental changes (such as the package becoming unsupported) could force the project to act on its abandonment. However, the project could continue using `standard-version` as long as it remains functional, reducing the immediate likelihood of needing to act.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of `standard-version` in the project's release process, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of `standard-version` would be impactful but not critically so. The project could transition to an alternative with some effort, but the process would not be trivial.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @ant-design/icons package provides a set of icons used in the UI components of the project. While icons are important for user interface design, they are not critical to the core functionality of the ML Testing Toolkit UI. The project could potentially use alternative icon sets or custom icons without significant impact on its core features.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @ant-design/icons package is likely used in conjunction with the antd package for UI components. Given that antd is a comprehensive UI library, replacing @ant-design/icons would require finding a compatible icon set that works well with antd or replacing antd altogether. This could involve significant changes to the UI components, making the integration depth moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative icon libraries available for React applications, such as FontAwesome, Material-UI Icons, and React Icons. These libraries offer a wide range of icons and could serve as suitable replacements for @ant-design/icons. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace the dependency.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. Icon libraries are generally stable, and changes in the environment that would necessitate a replacement of @ant-design/icons are unlikely. The project could continue using the current version of the package even if it were abandoned, as long as it meets the project's needs.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance, integration depth, availability of alternatives, and likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of @ant-design/icons would not likely be directly impactful to the ML Testing Toolkit UI project. The project could continue using the current version or switch to an alternative icon library with moderate effort.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "React is a core dependency for the project, as evidenced by its extensive usage across the codebase. It is used in almost every component and is essential for rendering the UI. The project's scripts, such as 'start', 'build', and 'test', are also configured to use React. Given its fundamental role in the project, the functionality provided by React is highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "React is deeply integrated into the project. It is used in the majority of the components, and the project's architecture is built around React's component-based structure. Replacing React would require a complete overhaul of the project's codebase, including rewriting all components and potentially changing the project's build and test configurations.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to React, such as Vue.js or Angular, migrating to these frameworks would be non-trivial. Each alternative has its own ecosystem and way of doing things, which would require significant changes to the project's codebase. Additionally, the project's developers are likely more familiar with React, adding to the difficulty of switching to an alternative.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on React's abandonment is low. React is maintained by Facebook and has a large, active community. It is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces, and its abandonment would have significant implications for the broader web development community. However, the possibility cannot be entirely ruled out, especially if a major security vulnerability is discovered or if Facebook decides to deprecate React in favor of a new technology.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given React's critical role in the project, its deep integration, the difficulty of replacing it, and the low likelihood of its abandonment, the abandonment of React would be highly impactful to the project. The project would face significant challenges in maintaining and updating its codebase without React, and the cost of migrating to an alternative would be substantial.",
