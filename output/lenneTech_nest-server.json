    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Multer is used for handling file uploads in the project, which is a critical functionality for user avatars and potentially other file uploads. The project has specific configurations and helper functions built around Multer, indicating its importance in the project's architecture.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Multer is integrated into the project through custom helper functions and configurations, such as `multerOptionsForImageUpload` and `multerRandomFileName`. It is also used in the avatar controller for handling user avatar uploads. This level of integration suggests that replacing Multer would require significant changes to the codebase.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Multer for handling file uploads in Node.js, such as `formidable`, `busboy`, and `express-fileupload`. However, the project has built specific functionalities around Multer, and switching to an alternative would require rewriting those parts of the code.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given Multer's popularity and active maintenance, the likelihood of it being abandoned in the near future is low. However, the Node.js ecosystem is dynamic, and changes in the ecosystem or in Multer's maintenance status could force the project to act.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of Multer for file uploads, its deep integration into the project, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of Multer would be impactful but not critically so. The project would need to invest time in replacing Multer, but it is manageable.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The `pretty-quick` package is used in the project for formatting staged files before committing. This functionality is important for maintaining code quality and consistency across the project. However, it is not directly related to the core functionality of the Nest server, which is the main focus of the project. Therefore, while important, it is not critical to the project's primary operations.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "`pretty-quick` is integrated into the project's development workflow through a script in the `package.json` file (`format:staged`). It is used in a pre-commit hook to format staged files. This indicates a moderate level of integration, as it is part of the development process but not deeply embedded in the core application logic.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to `pretty-quick` for formatting code in a pre-commit hook, such as `lint-staged` combined with `prettier`. These alternatives can provide similar functionality with minimal changes to the project's setup. The availability of suitable alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace `pretty-quick` if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. `pretty-quick` is a tool for code formatting, and its abandonment would not directly impact the runtime or deployment of the Nest server. Changes in the development environment or tools are less likely to force immediate action compared to changes in runtime dependencies.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of `pretty-quick` to the project's development workflow, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of `pretty-quick` would not likely be directly impactful to the project. It is a useful tool for maintaining code quality but not critical to the project's core functionality.",

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The nodemailer package is used in the email service of the project, which is crucial for sending emails. Given the project's nature as a server framework, email functionality is likely important for user notifications, password resets, and other communication needs. However, the project's README does not explicitly highlight email functionality as a core feature, suggesting it might not be the most critical component.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of nodemailer is limited to the email service, where it is used to create a transporter and send emails. The usage is straightforward and does not involve complex configurations or deep integration with other parts of the project. This makes it relatively easy to replace or remove if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to nodemailer for sending emails in Node.js, such as sendgrid, mailgun, and postmark. These alternatives provide similar or even enhanced functionalities and are widely used in the community. The availability of these alternatives makes it easier to replace nodemailer if needed.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on nodemailer's abandonment is low. Email sending is a well-established functionality, and changes in this area are rare. Additionally, the project's email service is abstracted in a way that makes it adaptable to changes in the underlying email sending library.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of email functionality in a server framework, nodemailer's role is significant but not critical. Its straightforward integration and the availability of alternatives make it relatively easy to replace. The low likelihood of external changes forcing action on its abandonment further reduces its impact. Therefore, while nodemailer's abandonment would be noteworthy, it would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",
