    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @dnd-kit/core package is used for drag and drop functionality, which is a critical feature in many user interfaces. Given that INGRED UI is a design system aimed at making it easy to build user interfaces, the ability to implement drag and drop interactions is likely important for creating dynamic and interactive components.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The project uses multiple packages from the @dnd-kit ecosystem (@dnd-kit/core, @dnd-kit/modifiers, @dnd-kit/sortable, @dnd-kit/utilities), indicating a deep integration of drag and drop functionality. Replacing this dependency would require significant changes to the codebase, especially if the drag and drop features are widely used across components.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative libraries for implementing drag and drop in React, such as react-beautiful-dnd and react-sortable-hoc. However, each library has its own API and feature set, which may not be a direct replacement for @dnd-kit/core. The availability of alternatives is good, but the effort to switch and adapt to a new library could be substantial.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the React ecosystem is stable, changes in React itself or in the broader JavaScript ecosystem could impact the viability of @dnd-kit/core. However, such changes are not imminent or highly likely.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of drag and drop functionality in user interfaces, the deep integration of @dnd-kit/core in the project, and the availability of alternatives, the abandonment of @dnd-kit/core would be impactful but not critically so. The project would need to invest effort in finding and integrating a replacement, but the impact is manageable.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @typescript-eslint/parser is used for parsing TypeScript code in the ESLint configuration. Given that the project is based on React and works well with TypeScript, ensuring the code adheres to TypeScript standards is crucial. However, the parser itself does not provide direct functionality to the end product but is more of a development tool. Therefore, while important, it is not critical to the project's core functionality.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @typescript-eslint/parser is integrated into the project through the ESLint configuration file (.eslintrc.js). Its usage is limited to the linting process, which is a part of the development workflow rather than the runtime or build process. This makes its integration relatively shallow and straightforward to replace or remove if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative parsers available for TypeScript code in ESLint, such as the default ESLint parser or other community-driven parsers. However, @typescript-eslint/parser is the most widely used and recommended parser for TypeScript projects, making it the preferred choice. While alternatives exist, they may not offer the same level of compatibility or features.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The @typescript-eslint/parser is a well-maintained project with a large community and is considered the standard for TypeScript projects. However, if the project were to be abandoned, the impact would be mitigated by the availability of alternatives and the parser's limited role in the project.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @typescript-eslint/parser in the development workflow, its shallow integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of forced action due to external changes, the abandonment of this dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project. It plays a crucial role in ensuring code quality and adherence to TypeScript standards but does not affect the project's runtime or core functionality.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @testing-library/react dependency is crucial for the project as it is used extensively across the codebase for testing React components. It provides utilities that encourage good testing practices and is integrated into the testing suite of the project. The project's reliance on this library for testing indicates its high importance to ensure the quality and reliability of the components.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is deeply integrated into the project's testing suite, as evidenced by its usage in numerous test files across various components. It is used for rendering components, simulating user interactions, and asserting expected outcomes. The widespread use across the project's test files indicates a high level of integration.",

    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to @testing-library/react, such as Enzyme, the project has standardized on @testing-library/react for its testing needs. The library's philosophy of testing components in a way that resembles how they are used in real applications makes it a preferred choice. However, the availability of alternatives means that replacing it, though not trivial, is feasible.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. @testing-library/react is a widely used and actively maintained library within the React ecosystem. However, the dynamic nature of software development means that unforeseen circumstances could arise, making it necessary to consider the impact of its abandonment.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role of @testing-library/react in the project's testing strategy, its abandonment would have a significant impact. The library's deep integration into the project and the lack of a straightforward replacement strategy mean that its abandonment would require substantial effort to mitigate. However, the low likelihood of such an event occurring reduces the immediate risk.",
