    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @nuxt/schema dependency is crucial for the nuxt-viewport project as it provides the necessary schema definitions and configurations for Nuxt modules. Given that nuxt-viewport is a Nuxt module, it relies heavily on @nuxt/schema for its integration and functionality within the Nuxt ecosystem. The project's README and package.json both indicate a direct dependency on @nuxt/schema, highlighting its importance in the module's setup and operation.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @nuxt/schema within the nuxt-viewport project is deep, as it is used for defining the module's schema and configurations. The project's package.json lists @nuxt/schema as a devDependency, indicating its use in the development and build process. The README also shows that the module is added to the `modules` section of `nuxt.config.js`, which suggests a tight integration with Nuxt's configuration system. Replacing @nuxt/schema would require significant changes to the module's core functionality and configuration handling.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are no direct alternatives to @nuxt/schema that provide the same level of integration and functionality within the Nuxt ecosystem. @nuxt/schema is specifically designed for Nuxt modules, offering unique features and configurations that are not easily replicated by other packages. While it might be possible to create custom solutions or use other schema definition tools, these would not offer the same seamless integration and support for Nuxt-specific features.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While @nuxt/schema is a core part of the Nuxt ecosystem, the Nuxt team is actively maintaining and updating the framework, reducing the risk of abandonment. However, if the Nuxt team were to deprecate or abandon @nuxt/schema, it would have a significant impact on the nuxt-viewport project, necessitating immediate action to find a replacement or alternative solution.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role of @nuxt/schema in the nuxt-viewport project, its abandonment would be highly impactful. The dependency is deeply integrated into the project, providing essential functionality and configurations that are not easily replaceable. While the likelihood of abandonment is moderate due to the active maintenance of the Nuxt ecosystem, the potential impact on the project is significant. Therefore, the abandonment of @nuxt/schema would likely be directly impactful to the nuxt-viewport project.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @nuxtjs/eslint-config-typescript dependency is used for linting TypeScript code in the project. While linting is important for maintaining code quality and consistency, it is not directly related to the core functionality of the nuxt-viewport module, which is to define custom viewports for Nuxt projects. Therefore, the functionality provided by this dependency is of moderate importance to the project.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project through the .eslintrc configuration file, which extends the @nuxtjs/eslint-config-typescript configuration. This is a standard way to integrate ESLint configurations and does not involve deep integration into the project's codebase. Replacing this dependency would primarily involve updating the .eslintrc file, which is a relatively straightforward task.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative ESLint configurations available for TypeScript projects, including eslint-config-standard-with-typescript and eslint-config-airbnb-typescript. These alternatives could serve as suitable replacements and provide similar functionality. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace the @nuxtjs/eslint-config-typescript dependency.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. ESLint configurations are generally stable, and changes in the TypeScript ecosystem are unlikely to render a specific ESLint configuration obsolete. Additionally, the project could continue to use an abandoned ESLint configuration as long as it remains compatible with the project's TypeScript version.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of the dependency's functionality, the low difficulty of replacing it due to its shallow integration and the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of the @nuxtjs/eslint-config-typescript dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the nuxt-viewport project.",

Therefore, its importance to the project is moderate.",
