    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency 'is-immutable-type' is crucial for the 'eslint-plugin-functional' project as it provides the core functionality to determine the immutability of types. This functionality is directly used in several rules and configurations within the project, as evidenced by the extensive usage in the codebase. The project's focus on promoting functional programming and immutability in JavaScript and TypeScript makes this dependency highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The 'is-immutable-type' dependency is deeply integrated into the 'eslint-plugin-functional' project. It is used across multiple files and rules, including settings, utilities, and specific rules like 'prefer-immutable-types' and 'type-declaration-immutability'. The dependency's functionality is embedded in the core logic of these rules, making it difficult to replace without significant refactoring.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are other libraries and tools that deal with immutability in TypeScript, 'is-immutable-type' offers specific features and configurations that are tailored to the needs of the 'eslint-plugin-functional' project. Finding a direct alternative that provides the same level of functionality and integration would be challenging. The project's reliance on specific features of 'is-immutable-type', such as its immutability overrides and detailed immutability levels, further complicates the search for suitable replacements.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the dependency is crucial for the project's functionality, the TypeScript ecosystem is relatively stable, and the 'is-immutable-type' library is actively maintained. However, changes in TypeScript's type system or shifts in the broader JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem could potentially impact the dependency's relevance or functionality.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role of 'is-immutable-type' in the 'eslint-plugin-functional' project, its deep integration, the lack of direct alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of this dependency would likely be directly impactful to the project. The project would face significant challenges in maintaining its core functionality and ensuring the continued effectiveness of its rules promoting functional programming and immutability.",

  },
  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency vitest is used extensively in the project for testing purposes. It is imported and used in multiple test files across the project, indicating its critical role in ensuring the functionality and reliability of the code. Given its widespread use in testing, the functionality provided by vitest is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Vitest is integrated into the project's test suite, as evidenced by its import and usage in numerous test files. However, its integration is limited to the testing environment and does not extend into the core functionality of the project. This makes it relatively easier to replace compared to dependencies that are deeply embedded in the project's main codebase.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative testing frameworks available for JavaScript and TypeScript projects, such as Jest, Mocha, and Jasmine. These alternatives could potentially serve as suitable replacements for vitest, providing similar testing capabilities. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace vitest, should the need arise.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on vitest's abandonment is relatively low. Testing frameworks are generally stable, and changes in the external environment are less likely to directly impact the choice of a testing framework. However, if vitest were to be abandoned, the project might need to consider switching to an alternative testing framework to ensure continued support and maintenance.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of vitest to the project's testing suite, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternative testing frameworks, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing a switch, the abandonment of vitest would be somewhat impactful but not critically so. The project could transition to an alternative testing framework with a reasonable amount of effort.",

  },
  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The eslint-plugin-promise dependency enforces best practices for JavaScript promises, which is a critical aspect of modern JavaScript development. Given that the project, eslint-plugin-functional, aims to promote functional programming in JavaScript and TypeScript, the proper handling of promises aligns well with functional programming principles. Therefore, the functionality provided by eslint-plugin-promise is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of eslint-plugin-promise within the project appears to be at a standard level for an ESLint plugin. It is listed as a devDependency in the package.json file, indicating it is used during development for linting purposes. There is no evidence of deep integration or custom configurations that would make it difficult to replace. Therefore, the difficulty of replacing the dependency, considering the depth of its integration in the project's code base, is low.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available that could serve as suitable replacements for eslint-plugin-promise, such as eslint-plugin-promise-replace or custom ESLint rules tailored for promise handling. These alternatives could provide similar functionality, making it relatively easy to replace eslint-plugin-promise if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the JavaScript ecosystem is dynamic, and dependencies can become abandoned, eslint-plugin-promise is widely used and maintained by the ESLint community. However, the possibility of abandonment cannot be entirely ruled out, especially if the maintainers decide to deprecate the plugin in favor of native ESLint rules or other alternatives.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the functionality provided by eslint-plugin-promise to the project, the ease of replacing it due to its standard level of integration and the availability of alternative packages, and the moderate likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of eslint-plugin-promise would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could transition to an alternative solution with relative ease if necessary.",
