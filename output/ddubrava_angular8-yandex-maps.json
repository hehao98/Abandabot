    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "ESLint is a crucial tool for maintaining code quality and consistency in JavaScript projects. It helps identify and report on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, which is essential for ensuring that the codebase adheres to best practices and standards. Given that the project 'angular-yandex-maps' is a library that provides Angular components for Yandex.Maps, maintaining high code quality is paramount for its reliability and usability. Therefore, the functionality provided by ESLint is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "ESLint is deeply integrated into the project's development workflow, as evidenced by its presence in multiple configuration files (e.g., .eslintrc.json files across different directories) and its use in the project's linting scripts. The project relies on ESLint for enforcing coding standards and identifying potential issues in the codebase. Replacing ESLint would require significant effort to reconfigure the project's linting setup and potentially adapt to a different tool's configuration and rules.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternative linting tools available for JavaScript, such as JSHint and JSLint, ESLint's pluggable architecture and extensive ecosystem of plugins make it a preferred choice for many projects. Its ability to use an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for evaluating patterns in code and its support for custom rules and configurations provide flexibility that is hard to match. However, the availability of alternatives does mean that replacing ESLint, while challenging, is not impossible.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on ESLint's abandonment is relatively low. ESLint is a widely used and actively maintained tool with a strong community and commercial support. However, changes in the JavaScript ecosystem or the emergence of a significantly better tool could potentially influence the project's decision to switch.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of ESLint to the project's code quality, its deep integration into the development workflow, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of ESLint would likely be impactful to the project. However, the impact could be mitigated by the availability of alternative tools and the project's ability to adapt to a new linting solution.",

      "reasoning": "The @swc/core dependency is used in the build process of the project, as indicated by its presence in the devDependencies section of the package.json file. It is a critical tool for compiling and optimizing JavaScript and TypeScript code, which is essential for the development and deployment of the project. Given its role in the build process, the functionality provided by @swc/core is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @swc/core in the project appears to be limited to the build process, as there are no direct references to it in the provided code snippets or dependency usage overview. This suggests that while it is important for the build process, it is not deeply integrated into the project's codebase. Therefore, replacing it would not require extensive changes to the project's code.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @swc/core for compiling and optimizing JavaScript and TypeScript code, such as Babel and TypeScript's own compiler (tsc). These alternatives are widely used and well-supported, making them suitable replacements for @swc/core. The availability of these alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacing @swc/core.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the abandonment of @swc/core is low. The project's build process is largely self-contained, and changes in the external environment are unlikely to directly impact the need for a specific build tool. Additionally, the availability of alternative tools further reduces the likelihood of being forced to act due to abandonment.",

    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @swc/core in the build process, its limited integration into the project's codebase, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of @swc/core would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could transition to an alternative build tool with relatively low effort.",

      "reasoning": "The @types/jest package provides TypeScript definitions for Jest, which is a testing framework. Given that the project includes Jest as a devDependency and has scripts for testing, it is clear that testing is an integral part of the project's development process. However, the direct impact of @types/jest on the project's core functionality (Yandex.Maps Angular components) is minimal. It primarily aids in development and testing phases rather than the runtime or core features of the application.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @types/jest package is used for TypeScript support in Jest tests. While it is integrated into the testing setup, its integration depth is limited to the development and testing environment. It does not deeply integrate into the core application code or the Yandex.Maps Angular components themselves. Replacing or removing it would primarily affect the TypeScript typing for Jest tests, which, while inconvenient, does not deeply impact the project's architecture or functionality.",

    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @types/jest for providing TypeScript definitions for Jest, including community-driven types or manually defining types. Additionally, if Jest were to be replaced with another testing framework, the need for @types/jest would be eliminated. The availability of alternatives and the possibility of switching testing frameworks reduce the difficulty of replacing @types/jest.",

      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the abandonment of @types/jest is low.

Changes in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem that would necessitate action on @types/jest are unlikely in the near future.",

    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, the abandonment of @types/jest would have a minimal impact on the project. Its role is primarily supportive in the development and testing phases, and it does not deeply integrate into the core functionality of the Yandex.Maps Angular components.
