    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The `jwk-to-pem` dependency is used in the project for converting JSON Web Keys (JWK) to PEM format, which is essential for cryptographic operations such as signing data. This functionality is crucial for wallet management and security features within the ArDrive Core library. Given its role in security and wallet management, the functionality provided by `jwk-to-pem` is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The `jwk-to-pem` dependency is integrated into the project's codebase in multiple places, including wallet management and cryptographic operations. Its usage is deeply embedded in the core functionalities related to security and data signing. Replacing this dependency would require significant changes to the codebase, especially in parts handling cryptographic operations and wallet management.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative packages available that can convert JWK to PEM format, such as `node-jose` and `pem-jwk`. However, the ease of replacement depends on the compatibility of these alternatives with the existing codebase and their ability to seamlessly integrate without requiring extensive modifications. Given the availability of alternatives, the difficulty of replacement is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is relatively low. The `jwk-to-pem` package is stable and widely used in the Node.js ecosystem. However, changes in cryptographic standards or security vulnerabilities could potentially necessitate a replacement.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of `jwk-to-pem` in cryptographic operations and wallet management, its deep integration into the project, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would be impactful to the project. The project would need to invest significant effort in finding and integrating a suitable replacement to maintain its security and functionality.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @istanbuljs/nyc-config-typescript package provides default configuration for instrumenting TypeScript projects with test coverage using nyc. While it is useful for ensuring code quality and test coverage, it is not directly involved in the core functionality of the ArDrive Core library, which focuses on file management, Permaweb upload/download, and wallet management. Therefore, its importance to the project is moderate but not critical.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @istanbuljs/nyc-config-typescript in the project is minimal. It is used in the nyc.config.js file to extend the default configuration for TypeScript projects. This indicates a shallow integration that does not deeply affect the project's codebase. Replacing or removing this dependency would require minimal changes to the project's configuration.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives available for configuring nyc with TypeScript projects, including custom configurations or other community-provided configurations. The availability of alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace @istanbuljs/nyc-config-typescript if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The package is focused on test coverage configuration, which is a stable aspect of development. Changes in the broader ecosystem are unlikely to directly impact the necessity of this specific configuration package.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance, shallow integration, availability of alternatives, and low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @istanbuljs/nyc-config-typescript would not likely be directly impactful to the ArDrive Core project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The axios-retry dependency is used to handle retries for failed HTTP requests in the project. Given the nature of the ArDrive Core library, which involves file management, Permaweb upload/download, and wallet management, reliable HTTP communication is crucial. The retry mechanism provided by axios-retry ensures that transient network issues do not disrupt these operations, making it an important component for the project's reliability and user experience.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of axios-retry in the project is relatively straightforward and limited to the creation of an Axios instance with retry capabilities. It is used in a single utility function (`createAxiosInstance`) to configure the Axios instance with retry logic. This limited scope of integration suggests that replacing or removing axios-retry would not require extensive changes to the codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available that provide similar retry functionality for Axios requests, such as 'axios-retry-interceptor' and 'axios-retry-promise'. These alternatives offer comparable features and could serve as suitable replacements with minimal adjustments to the code. The availability of these alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacing axios-retry.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The functionality provided by axios-retry is relatively stable and not subject to frequent changes in web standards or protocols. Additionally, the project's use of axios-retry is not deeply tied to specific external services or APIs that might change in a way that would necessitate a replacement.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of reliable HTTP communication for the ArDrive Core library, the functionality provided by axios-retry is significant. However, its limited integration scope and the availability of suitable alternatives reduce the potential impact of its abandonment. The low likelihood of external changes necessitating action further supports the conclusion that the abandonment of axios-retry would not be directly impactful to the project.",
