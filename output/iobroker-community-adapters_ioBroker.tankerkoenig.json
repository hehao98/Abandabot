      "reasoning": "The @mui/material dependency is used extensively across multiple components in the admin interface of the ioBroker.tankerkoenig project. It provides essential UI components such as cards, buttons, dialogs, and typography that are crucial for the user interface. Given its widespread use and the fact that it is a core part of the admin UI, the functionality provided by @mui/material is highly important to the project.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "@mui/material is deeply integrated into the project's codebase, as evidenced by its use in multiple components across the admin interface. Replacing it would require significant refactoring of the UI components, which are tightly coupled with the Material-UI components. This deep integration makes it difficult to replace without substantial effort.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative UI component libraries available, such as Ant Design, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS, which could potentially replace @mui/material. However, each of these alternatives has its own set of components and design philosophies, which would require significant adjustments to the existing codebase. While alternatives exist, the effort to switch to another library would be considerable.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While @mui/material is a widely used library with a large community, any significant changes or abandonment by its maintainers could impact the project. However, given its popularity and the active community, the risk is somewhat mitigated.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @mui/material to the project's UI, its deep integration, the availability of alternatives, and the likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of this dependency would likely be impactful. The project would need to undertake significant refactoring to replace it, and the UI would be directly affected.",

      "reasoning": "The @emotion/styled dependency is used for styling components in the project. Given the project's focus on providing a user interface for fuel prices, styling is crucial for user experience. However, the core functionality of fetching and displaying fuel prices does not directly depend on @emotion/styled. Therefore, while important, it is not critical to the project's primary functionality.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "@emotion/styled is integrated into the project for styling components, which is a significant part of the user interface. Replacing it would require updating all styled components, which could be time-consuming but is manageable with careful planning and execution.",

    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @emotion/styled for styling React components, such as styled-components, Material-UI's styling solution, and plain CSS modules. These alternatives can provide similar functionality, making it feasible to replace @emotion/styled if necessary.",

      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low.

However, changes in the React ecosystem or significant updates to @emotion/styled could influence this likelihood.",

While this functionality is important for ensuring a clean build environment, it is not directly related to the core functionality of the project, which is to provide fuel prices from tankerkoenig.de.

      "reasoning": "'rimraf' is integrated into the project's build scripts, specifically in the 'prebuild', 'prebuild:ts', and 'prebuild:react' scripts. This indicates that it is used at the beginning of the build process to remove previous build artifacts. While this integration is straightforward, replacing 'rimraf' would require modifying these scripts, which is a relatively simple task.",

    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to 'rimraf' that can perform the same directory cleanup functionality, such as 'del', 'fs-extra', and native Node.js 'fs' module methods. These alternatives are well-maintained and widely used, making it relatively easy to replace 'rimraf' if necessary.",

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on 'rimraf's abandonment is low. 'rimraf' is a stable and widely used package, and its functionality is not dependent on external services or APIs that could change. Additionally, the project's build process is not likely to be affected by changes in the broader JavaScript ecosystem that would necessitate a replacement for 'rimraf'.",
