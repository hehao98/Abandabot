      "reasoning": "The @cortex-js/compute-engine dependency is crucial for MathLive as it provides symbolic manipulation and numeric evaluation of MathJSON expressions. This functionality is integral to MathLive's core feature of rendering and editing math formulas. The dependency is directly used in the project's codebase for parsing LaTeX to MathJSON and evaluating expressions, which are essential operations for MathLive's functionality.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @cortex-js/compute-engine is deeply integrated into MathLive's codebase, as evidenced by its usage in critical parts of the project such as the build script and the server-side rendering (SSR) component. The dependency is not just a peripheral utility but is embedded within the core operations of MathLive, making its replacement a complex task that would require significant refactoring of the codebase.",

    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are other libraries available for mathematical computations and LaTeX parsing, finding a direct replacement that offers the same level of integration, functionality, and compatibility with MathLive's specific needs would be challenging. The @cortex-js/compute-engine is tailored for MathJSON, which is a core aspect of MathLive's operation, making suitable alternatives scarce.",

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the specialized nature of the @cortex-js/compute-engine and its close integration with MathLive, external environmental changes that would force the project to act on the dependency's abandonment are less likely. However, the dependency's abandonment could still pose a significant risk if it were to occur, given its importance and integration level.",

    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the critical role of @cortex-js/compute-engine in MathLive's functionality, its deep integration into the project's codebase, the difficulty in finding suitable alternatives, and the potential impact of its abandonment, it is clear that the dependency's abandonment would be highly impactful to the project. The project relies heavily on the dependency for core operations, and its loss would necessitate significant effort to mitigate, making the dependency's abandonment a noteworthy concern.",

It is responsible for bundling and minifying the JavaScript code, which is a critical step in the development and deployment process. However, the core functionality of MathLive, which is providing a web component for math input, does not directly depend on esbuild. Therefore, while esbuild is important for the build process, it is not central to the main functionality of the project.",
