    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Vite is a core build tool for the ZUI project, as indicated by its use in the development and build scripts. It is essential for the development server, build process, and documentation generation. The project's README and package.json both highlight Vite as a key technology in the project's tech stack.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Vite is deeply integrated into the project, as evidenced by its use in multiple scripts and configuration files. It is used for the development server, build process, and documentation generation. The project's build and development workflows are heavily reliant on Vite, making it difficult to replace without significant refactoring.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternative build tools available (e.g., Webpack, Rollup), Vite's unique features, such as its fast HMR and native ES modules support, make it a preferred choice for modern web development. Finding a replacement that offers the same level of performance and developer experience would be challenging.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Vite's abandonment is moderate. While Vite is currently a popular and actively maintained project, the fast-paced nature of frontend development means that new tools and technologies can quickly emerge. However, given Vite's current popularity and the project's deep integration with it, such a scenario is not immediately likely.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given Vite's critical role in the ZUI project's development and build processes, its abandonment would likely be directly impactful. The project would need to find a suitable replacement and undergo significant refactoring, which could disrupt development and delay releases.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin is used for linting TypeScript code, which is crucial for maintaining code quality and consistency in a TypeScript project. Given that ZUI 3 is built using TypeScript, this plugin plays a significant role in the development process by enforcing coding standards and catching potential errors early.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The plugin is integrated into the project's linting process, as indicated by the presence of ESLint and TypeScript-related configurations in the package.json. However, its integration is not deeply embedded into the core functionality of the project but rather serves as a development tool. Replacing it would require adjustments to the linting configuration but would not affect the core functionality of the UI components.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative linting tools and plugins available for TypeScript, such as TSLint (though deprecated) and other ESLint plugins that can be configured to work with TypeScript. However, @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin is the most widely used and recommended solution for linting TypeScript code, making it somewhat difficult to find a direct replacement with the same level of community support and features.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is relatively low. The plugin is actively maintained and widely used in the TypeScript community. However, if the plugin were to be abandoned, the project might need to switch to an alternative linting solution to ensure continued code quality and compatibility with future TypeScript versions.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of linting in maintaining code quality, the @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin is somewhat impactful to the project. However, its role is more supportive rather than critical to the core functionality of the UI components. The availability of alternatives and the relatively low likelihood of abandonment suggest that the dependency's abandonment would not be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The project, ZUI 3, is described as a UI component library that does not depend on any JavaScript framework and can be used in any web application in a native way. The dependency, jQuery, is listed in the devDependencies of the package.json file, indicating it is not directly used in the production build of the project. Given the project's emphasis on not depending on any JavaScript framework and the fact that jQuery is only a devDependency, the functionality provided by jQuery is not crucial to the project's core functionality.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency usage overview shows that jQuery is only referenced in a single file, `scripts/libs/lib-info.ts`, and there is no evidence of deep integration within the project's codebase. The project's README and the provided code snippets do not indicate any significant integration of jQuery in the project's main functionalities. Therefore, replacing jQuery would not be difficult due to its minimal integration.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are numerous alternative packages available that could serve as suitable replacements for jQuery, such as Cash, Zepto, or even native JavaScript methods. The project already uses `cash-dom` in its dependencies, which is a lightweight alternative to jQuery. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace jQuery if necessary.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given that jQuery is only a devDependency and the project does not heavily rely on it, the likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on jQuery's abandonment is low. The project's architecture and the minimal use of jQuery suggest that its abandonment would not significantly impact the project.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the minimal importance of jQuery to the project's core functionality, its shallow integration within the codebase, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes necessitating action, the abandonment of jQuery would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",
