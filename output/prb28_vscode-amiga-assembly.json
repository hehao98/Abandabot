    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "TypeScript is crucial for the project as it is used throughout the codebase for type checking, linting, and ensuring code quality. The project's package.json lists TypeScript as a devDependency, and it is referenced in various configuration files and source code files, indicating its integral role in the development process.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "TypeScript is deeply integrated into the project, as evidenced by its use in the build process, linting, and testing. The project's .vscode/settings.json file specifies the TypeScript SDK path, and TypeScript is used in multiple source files for type annotations and other TypeScript-specific features. This deep integration suggests that replacing TypeScript would require significant changes to the project's build and development processes.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to TypeScript, such as Babel for JavaScript transpilation and Flow for type checking, these alternatives may not provide the same level of integration with Visual Studio Code or the same ecosystem of tools and libraries. Additionally, the project's specific use of TypeScript features and configurations would make transitioning to an alternative challenging.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on TypeScript's abandonment is low. TypeScript is widely used and supported by Microsoft, and there is a large community and ecosystem around it. However, if TypeScript were to be abandoned, the project would need to find an alternative or fork and maintain TypeScript itself, which would be a significant undertaking.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given TypeScript's importance to the project, its deep integration, the challenges in finding suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of TypeScript would be highly impactful to the project. The project relies on TypeScript for its development process, and replacing it would require significant effort and changes to the codebase and build processes.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The copy-webpack-plugin is used to copy specific directories (node_modules/uae-dap/wasm and node_modules/uae-dap/bin) to the build directory. This functionality is crucial for the project as it ensures that necessary files are available in the correct location for the extension to function properly. Without this, the extension might not work as expected, especially in environments where these files are required for debugging and running Amiga Assembly code.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of copy-webpack-plugin in the project is minimal and straightforward. It is used in the webpack.config.js file to copy specific directories. The plugin is configured with a simple pattern that specifies the source and destination directories. This indicates that the plugin is not deeply integrated into the project's codebase, and its removal or replacement would not require significant changes to the project's structure or logic.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to copy-webpack-plugin that could be used to copy files during the build process, such as file-loader, cpy-cli, or even custom scripts using Node.js's fs module. These alternatives can provide similar functionality, and some might offer additional features or better performance. However, the ease of use and integration with webpack makes copy-webpack-plugin a convenient choice for this project.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The copy-webpack-plugin is a well-maintained and widely used plugin in the webpack ecosystem. It is unlikely to be abandoned in the near future. However, if it were to be abandoned, the impact on the project would be minimal due to the availability of alternatives and the plugin's straightforward integration.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the functionality provided by copy-webpack-plugin, its minimal integration in the project, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of its abandonment, the impact of its abandonment on the project would be moderate. The project would need to find an alternative solution for copying files during the build process, but this would not significantly disrupt the project's functionality or development.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The webpack-cli is used in the build process of the project, as indicated by the scripts section in the package.json file. It is essential for running webpack commands, which are crucial for bundling the project's assets. However, the project's core functionality, which revolves around Amiga Assembly support for Visual Studio Code, does not directly depend on webpack-cli. The dependency is more related to the development and build process rather than the runtime functionality of the extension.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The webpack-cli is integrated into the project's build process through npm scripts. It is used for running webpack commands during development and for preparing the project for publishing. While it is a part of the development workflow, its integration is not deeply embedded into the core codebase of the project. The project could potentially switch to another build tool or modify its build process without affecting the core functionality of the extension.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to webpack-cli for running webpack commands, such as using webpack directly without the CLI, or switching to other build tools like Rollup or Parcel. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace webpack-cli if necessary. However, the transition might require some adjustments to the build process and scripts.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the abandonment of webpack-cli is low. The project's core functionality is not directly dependent on webpack-cli, and the build process can be adapted to use other tools if needed. Additionally, webpack-cli is a widely used tool with a large community, making it less likely to be abandoned in the near future.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance, integration, alternatives, and likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of webpack-cli would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The dependency is more related to the development and build process rather than the core functionality of the extension. There are also several alternatives available, and the likelihood of webpack-cli being abandoned is low.",
