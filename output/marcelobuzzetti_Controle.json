    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The project uses axios for making HTTP requests, which is a core functionality for any web application that needs to communicate with a server. The dependency is directly required in the project's PHP and template files, indicating its essential role in the application's operation.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Axios is integrated into the project through direct script includes in PHP and template files. This indicates a straightforward integration without complex configurations or deep modifications to the project's architecture. Replacing axios would require updating these script references and ensuring compatibility with the rest of the application.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to axios for making HTTP requests in JavaScript, such as Fetch API, jQuery.ajax, and other libraries like SuperAgent. These alternatives provide similar functionalities and could serve as suitable replacements. However, the ease of replacement depends on the specific features of axios used in the project and the compatibility of these alternatives with the project's existing codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on axios's abandonment is low. Axios is a widely used and actively maintained library with a large community and ecosystem. However, unforeseen circumstances such as security vulnerabilities or significant changes in web standards could potentially impact its viability.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the importance of axios to the project's functionality, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of axios would likely be impactful to the project. However, the impact could be mitigated by the availability of suitable alternatives and the straightforward nature of its integration.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The toastr library is used for displaying non-blocking notifications in the project. It is integrated into multiple template files and is used to provide feedback to users, such as error messages. While it enhances user experience, the core functionality of the project (vehicle management system) does not heavily rely on it. Therefore, its importance is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "toastr is integrated into several template files (header_abastecimento.tpl, header.tpl, header_relatorio.tpl, header_datatables.tpl, menuLogin.tpl) and is used for displaying notifications. The integration is straightforward, with CSS and JS files being included and toastr options being configured. Replacing it would require updating these template files, but the changes would be localized and not deeply intertwined with the core logic of the application.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative libraries available for displaying non-blocking notifications in web applications, such as Noty, PNotify, and SweetAlert. These alternatives offer similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements for toastr. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace toastr if needed.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on toastr's abandonment is low. toastr is a stable library with a long history, and while it is possible for any library to be abandoned, there are no immediate signs or trends suggesting that toastr will be abandoned soon. Additionally, the project's use of toastr is not tied to any external services or APIs that could change.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of toastr to the project, the relatively easy integration and availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of toastr would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could transition to an alternative library with minimal effort if necessary.",
    "impactful": false

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The mysql dependency is crucial for the project as it is used extensively for database operations across various parts of the project, including server.js, bot.js, and multiple model files. The project relies on mysql for connecting to and interacting with the database, which is a core functionality of the system.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The mysql dependency is deeply integrated into the project. It is used in multiple files and configurations, including Docker setups, environment configurations, and direct database operations in the code. Replacing it would require significant changes across the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to mysql, such as PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MariaDB, which could potentially serve as replacements. However, switching to an alternative would require changes to the database schema, queries, and possibly the ORM or database abstraction layer used in the project.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. MySQL is a widely used and supported database system, and its abandonment is unlikely in the near future. However, changes in the project's requirements or the emergence of a significantly better alternative could prompt a switch.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the importance and deep integration of the mysql dependency in the project, its abandonment would likely be directly impactful. However, the availability of alternatives and the low likelihood of forced environmental changes mitigate the impact to some extent.",
