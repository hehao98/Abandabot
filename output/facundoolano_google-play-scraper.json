    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The 'got' dependency is used extensively throughout the project for making HTTP requests, which is a core functionality for a scraper tool like google-play-scraper. It is used in various modules such as request handling, throttling, and processing of data from the Google Play store. Given its central role in the project's operation, its functionality is highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The 'got' dependency is deeply integrated into the project, as evidenced by its usage across multiple files and modules. It is not only used for making HTTP requests but also for handling cookies, throttling requests, and processing responses. This deep integration makes it difficult to replace without significant refactoring of the codebase.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to 'got' such as 'axios', 'node-fetch', and 'superagent', the project's specific use of 'got' features like cookie handling, throttling, and advanced request options may not be directly supported by these alternatives. This could require additional work to implement missing features or adapt the code to work with a different library.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the widespread use of 'got' in the Node.js ecosystem and its active maintenance, the likelihood of it being abandoned in the near future is low. However, the Node.js ecosystem is dynamic, and changes in the environment or the emergence of new standards could potentially impact the relevance of 'got'.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of 'got' to the project's core functionality, its deep integration, the availability of alternatives with potential adaptation challenges, and the low likelihood of its abandonment, the abandonment of 'got' would likely be impactful to the project. However, the impact could be mitigated by the availability of alternatives and the project's ability to adapt to changes.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The `eslint-plugin-promise` dependency is used for enforcing best practices for JavaScript promises in the project. While it is important for maintaining code quality and consistency, the core functionality of the `google-play-scraper` project does not directly depend on it. The project's primary functionality revolves around scraping data from the Google Play store, which does not inherently require the use of promises or their best practices. Therefore, the importance of this dependency to the project is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The `eslint-plugin-promise` is integrated into the project as a development dependency, specifically for linting purposes. It is configured in the `.eslintrc.json` file and used during the development process to enforce coding standards related to promises. However, its integration is not deeply embedded into the core functionality or the main codebase of the project. Replacing or removing this dependency would primarily affect the linting process and not the operational aspects of the project.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives available for enforcing best practices with JavaScript promises, such as `eslint-plugin-promise-fixes` and custom ESLint rules. These alternatives can provide similar functionality and could be used as replacements if necessary. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace `eslint-plugin-promise` without significantly impacting the project's development process.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The `eslint-plugin-promise` is a well-maintained plugin with a stable API, and its abandonment would not directly affect the project's ability to scrape data from the Google Play store. Any changes would likely be related to the development process and could be managed without urgent action.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, the abandonment of `eslint-plugin-promise` would not likely be directly impactful to the `google-play-scraper` project. While it plays a role in maintaining code quality, its functionality is not critical to the core operations of the project. There are also viable alternatives available, and the integration of this dependency is not deeply embedded into the project's main codebase. Therefore, the impact of its abandonment would be minimal.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Chai is used extensively in the test files of the project to assert the correctness of the functionality. It is a critical part of the testing suite, ensuring that the scraper works as expected. Without it, the project would lack a reliable way to validate its output, which is essential for maintaining the quality and reliability of the library.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Chai is deeply integrated into the test files, with assertions spread across multiple test cases. It is used to validate the structure and content of the data returned by the scraper, making it a core component of the testing framework. Replacing it would require updating all test files to use a different assertion library, which would be a significant effort.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Chai, such as Jest's built-in assertions, Node's built-in assert module, or other assertion libraries like Should.js or Expect.js. These alternatives could provide similar functionality, but switching would require rewriting the test cases to accommodate the new library's syntax and features.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Chai's abandonment is low. Chai is a well-established library with a large user base and active maintenance. However, if it were to be abandoned, the project would need to find a replacement to ensure the continued reliability of its tests.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given Chai's critical role in the project's testing suite, its deep integration, and the availability of alternatives, the abandonment of Chai would be impactful but manageable. The project would need to invest time in transitioning to a new assertion library, but this is a feasible task given the alternatives available.",
