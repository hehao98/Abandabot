      "reasoning": "The `eslint-plugin-promise` enforces best practices for JavaScript promises, which is crucial for maintaining code quality and preventing common promise-related bugs. Given that the project `bildvitta/asteroid` is a Quasar App Extension and Design System, maintaining high code quality is essential for its widespread use and reliability. The plugin's rules help ensure that promises are used correctly, which is particularly important in a project that likely involves asynchronous operations for handling API requests, UI updates, and other tasks.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The `eslint-plugin-promise` is integrated into the project's linting process, as indicated by its presence in the `package.json` file under `devDependencies`. The project uses ESLint for linting, and the plugin is configured to enforce promise best practices. However, the integration depth is moderate because it is part of the broader linting setup and not directly tied to the core functionality or specific components of the project. Replacing it would require updating the ESLint configuration but would not necessitate changes to the project's core logic or components.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative ESLint plugins and rules that can enforce promise best practices, such as custom ESLint rules or other plugins that focus on asynchronous code quality. However, `eslint-plugin-promise` is well-maintained and widely used, making it a standard choice for this purpose. Finding a suitable replacement that offers the same level of functionality and community support might be challenging, but not impossible.",

    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The plugin is focused on JavaScript promise best practices, which are a stable part of the language. Changes in the JavaScript ecosystem or the project's requirements that would necessitate replacing the plugin are unlikely in the near future. However, if the plugin were to become abandoned, the project might eventually need to find an alternative to ensure ongoing code quality.",

    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of maintaining high code quality in the `bildvitta/asteroid` project, the `eslint-plugin-promise` plays a significant role in enforcing best practices for JavaScript promises. While it is not deeply integrated into the project's core functionality and there are alternatives available, its abandonment would still be impactful due to the essential nature of its functionality. However, the likelihood of external changes forcing the project to act on its abandonment is low.",

      "reasoning": "The eslint-plugin-node is used to enforce additional ESLint rules specific to Node.js. Given that the project is a Quasar App Extension and likely involves Node.js for backend or build processes, the plugin's rules are important for maintaining code quality and consistency. However, the project's primary focus is on frontend development with Quasar, so the plugin's importance is somewhat mitigated by the project's scope.",

Replacing it would require updating these configurations, but the process is not deeply embedded in the project's codebase.",

      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to eslint-plugin-node, such as eslint-plugin-import and eslint-plugin-promise, which can also enforce Node.js-specific rules. Additionally, ESLint's core rules and other plugins can cover some of the functionality provided by eslint-plugin-node. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace the plugin.",
