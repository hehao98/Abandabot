      "reasoning": "The vue-recaptcha dependency is used in the login and sign-in components of the omegaup project, which are critical for user authentication. Given that authentication is a fundamental aspect of the platform, the functionality provided by vue-recaptcha is highly important. It helps in preventing automated abuse by verifying that the user is not a bot.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "vue-recaptcha is integrated into the login and sign-in components, which are essential parts of the application. However, its usage is limited to these components, and it does not appear to be deeply integrated into the core logic or other parts of the application. This makes it relatively easier to replace compared to dependencies that are more deeply embedded in the project's architecture.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to vue-recaptcha for implementing CAPTCHA in Vue.js applications, such as vue-recaptcha-v3 and vue-google-recaptcha. These alternatives provide similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace vue-recaptcha.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While CAPTCHA is important for security, changes in CAPTCHA technology or Google's reCAPTCHA service could necessitate a replacement. However, such changes are not frequent, and the project could continue using the current implementation for a significant period before needing to act.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the functionality provided by vue-recaptcha for user authentication and security, its integration into critical components, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of vue-recaptcha would likely be impactful to the project. However, the impact could be mitigated by the availability of alternatives and the relatively straightforward integration of a replacement.",

      "reasoning": "The vue-cookies dependency is used across multiple components in the omegaup project for handling browser cookies. This functionality is crucial for managing user sessions, preferences, and other cookie-based data. Given its widespread use in various components, the functionality provided by vue-cookies is important for the project's operation.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "vue-cookies is integrated into the project by being imported and used in multiple Vue components. The integration is straightforward, with the dependency being initialized with a specific configuration in each component. However, since it is used in several places, replacing it would require changes across multiple files, indicating a moderate level of integration difficulty.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available for handling cookies in Vue.js, such as vue-cookie, vue-cookie-law, and js-cookie. These alternatives provide similar functionality and could serve as suitable replacements. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace vue-cookies, provided that the replacement process is carefully managed to ensure compatibility and functionality.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the dependency is actively maintained and widely used, changes in web standards or security practices could necessitate a reevaluation of cookie handling mechanisms. However, such changes are not imminent, making the likelihood of immediate action low.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the functionality provided by vue-cookies, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternative packages, and the low likelihood of immediate external changes forcing action, the abandonment of vue-cookies would not likely be directly impactful to the project in the short term. However, it is important to monitor the situation and consider alternatives if the dependency's maintenance status changes.",

      "reasoning": "Vuex is used extensively across the project for state management, particularly in the problem creator, arena, and grader components. It is central to managing the state of various features such as problem cases, contest rankings, and grader settings. Given its widespread use and critical role in the application's architecture, the functionality provided by Vuex is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Vuex is deeply integrated into the project, with multiple stores created for different parts of the application (e.g., problem creator, arena, grader). The project's components rely heavily on Vuex for state management, as evidenced by the numerous imports and uses of Vuex across various files. Replacing Vuex would require significant refactoring of the codebase to remove or replace its usage, indicating a high level of integration difficulty.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to Vuex, such as Pinia (which is now the official recommendation for Vue state management), migrating to an alternative would still require a substantial effort. The project's deep integration with Vuex and the need to ensure compatibility with existing features and components make the replacement process challenging. However, the availability of Pinia, which offers a similar API and is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Vuex, somewhat mitigates the difficulty.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given that Vuex is still being maintained (albeit with no new features being added) and the existence of Pinia as a recommended alternative, the likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Vuex's abandonment is moderate. However, the project could continue using Vuex for the foreseeable future without immediate issues, especially since Vuex 3 and 4 are still supported.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of Vuex to the project's state management, its deep integration, the availability of alternatives like Pinia, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of Vuex would be impactful but not immediately critical. The project could continue using Vuex for some time, but planning for a migration to Pinia or another state management solution would be advisable to future-proof the application.",
