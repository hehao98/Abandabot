    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The styled-components library is used extensively throughout the project for styling components. It is integrated into various parts of the application, including UI components, navigation, and layout elements. Given its widespread use, the functionality provided by styled-components is crucial for maintaining the visual consistency and styling of the application.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "styled-components is deeply integrated into the project, as evidenced by its usage across multiple files and components. The project uses styled-components for defining styles directly within the components, which means that replacing it would require a significant refactoring effort to either inline styles or adopt a different CSS-in-JS solution.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to styled-components, such as Emotion, JSS, and vanilla CSS with CSS Modules. These alternatives offer similar functionalities and could potentially serve as suitable replacements. However, transitioning to an alternative would still require a considerable amount of work to refactor the existing styled-components code.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While styled-components is a popular library with a large community and active maintenance, the JavaScript ecosystem is known for its rapid changes. If styled-components were to be abandoned, the project might need to consider alternatives to ensure long-term maintainability.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the extensive use of styled-components in the project for styling components, its abandonment would have a significant impact. The project would face challenges in maintaining its current styling approach and would need to invest considerable effort in refactoring or adopting an alternative solution. Therefore, the abandonment of styled-components would likely be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @vercel/analytics dependency is used for tracking page views and custom events in the Next.js app. While analytics are important for understanding user behavior and improving the app, the core functionality of the project (calculating and displaying rankings for pedestrian and cyclable cities) does not directly depend on analytics. Therefore, the functionality provided by @vercel/analytics is somewhat important but not critical to the project's main objectives.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @vercel/analytics in the project is minimal. It is only used in the layout.tsx file to inject the Analytics script into the app. There are no complex integrations or deep dependencies on this package within the project's codebase. Replacing or removing this dependency would not require significant changes to the project's code.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative analytics packages available that could serve as suitable replacements for @vercel/analytics, such as Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or Plausible Analytics. These alternatives provide similar functionality and could be integrated with minimal effort. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace @vercel/analytics if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. Analytics services are generally stable, and even if @vercel/analytics were to be abandoned, the project could continue to function without analytics or switch to an alternative with minimal disruption.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the minimal integration, the availability of alternatives, and the non-critical nature of the functionality provided by @vercel/analytics, the abandonment of this dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could continue to operate without analytics or switch to an alternative with minimal effort.",
    "impactful": false

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The webpack-dev-server is crucial for the development environment of the project, providing live reloading and a development server. This functionality is essential for efficient development and debugging processes, especially in a project that involves complex calculations and frequent updates like laem/villes.plus.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The project uses NextJS v13 'app router', which likely integrates webpack-dev-server for development purposes. Given the complexity of the project and the need for live reloading during development, the integration of webpack-dev-server is deep and essential for the development workflow.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to webpack-dev-server, such as Vite or Parcel, switching to an alternative would require significant changes to the development setup and configuration. The project's reliance on webpack and its ecosystem makes webpack-dev-server the most straightforward and integrated choice.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the active maintenance and widespread use of webpack-dev-server, the likelihood of it being abandoned in the near future is low. However, the project's dependency on it for development means that any future abandonment would require immediate action to find and integrate an alternative.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of webpack-dev-server to the development process, its deep integration into the project, and the effort required to replace it, the abandonment of webpack-dev-server would be impactful to the project. However, the low likelihood of abandonment mitigates the immediate risk.",
