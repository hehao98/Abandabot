    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "TypeScript is used in the project for type checking and to enhance the development experience by providing static typing. Given that the project is a React wrapper for Google Charts, TypeScript's role is crucial for ensuring that the components are correctly typed and for catching errors at compile time. This is particularly important for a library that aims to be fully typed, as indicated in the project's README. Therefore, the functionality provided by TypeScript is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "TypeScript is integrated into the project's build and development processes, as seen in the rollup.config.js and .storybook/main.js files. It is used for parsing and transforming TypeScript and TSX files, indicating a deep integration into the project's codebase. Replacing TypeScript would require significant changes to the build configuration and potentially the codebase itself to accommodate a different type system or to remove static typing altogether.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to TypeScript, such as Flow or even using plain JavaScript with JSDoc comments, these alternatives may not provide the same level of type safety and developer experience that TypeScript offers. Additionally, given that the project is already set up to use TypeScript, switching to an alternative would require a considerable amount of work to refactor the codebase and update the build and development tooling.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on TypeScript's abandonment is relatively low. TypeScript is widely used and supported by a large community, including major tech companies. It is unlikely to be abandoned in the near future. However, if TypeScript were to be abandoned, the project would need to consider alternative solutions for static typing, which could be a significant undertaking.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of TypeScript to the project for ensuring type safety and enhancing the development experience, its deep integration into the project's build and development processes, the availability of alternatives that may not offer the same benefits, and the low likelihood of TypeScript being abandoned, the abandonment of TypeScript would likely be impactful to the project. However, given the current stability and widespread use of TypeScript, the immediate impact is mitigated.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency 'turbo' is used in the project's build, lint, test, and storybook scripts, indicating it plays a crucial role in the development and build process. However, it is not directly involved in the core functionality of the React Google Charts library itself, which is the main product of the project. Therefore, while important for development workflows, its impact on the end product is indirect.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Turbo is integrated into the project's scripts for building, linting, testing, and running storybook. This suggests a moderate level of integration, as it is used across various development tasks but not deeply embedded in the core application code. Replacing it would require updating these scripts and potentially the configuration files, but it would not necessitate changes to the main application logic.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Turbo for task running and monorepo management, such as Lerna, Nx, and custom npm scripts. These alternatives could potentially replace Turbo with some configuration changes. The availability of these alternatives makes the replacement process less difficult, although it would still require some effort to migrate and ensure compatibility.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Turbo's abandonment is low. Turbo is a development tool, and its abandonment would not directly affect the end users of the React Google Charts library. The project could continue using Turbo as long as it functions, and there would be no immediate need to switch unless significant issues arise or the project's development practices change.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the analysis, Turbo's abandonment would not likely be directly impactful to the project. It is important for the development workflow but not for the core functionality of the React Google Charts library. There are also viable alternatives available, and the likelihood of external changes forcing action is low. Therefore, while the project would need to address Turbo's abandonment eventually, it would not be an urgent or highly impactful issue.",

However, it is not directly involved in the core functionality of the React Google Charts library, which is to render Google Charts in React applications. Therefore, while it is useful for development and maintenance, its importance to the core functionality of the project is limited.",
