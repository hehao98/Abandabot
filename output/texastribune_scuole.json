    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The `fs-extra` package is used in multiple tasks within the project, including copying files, processing styles, handling images, managing paths, and cleaning directories. These tasks are essential for the build process and maintaining the project's static assets. The functionality provided by `fs-extra` is crucial for these operations, as it extends the native `fs` module with additional methods and promise support, making file system operations more efficient and easier to manage.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "`fs-extra` is deeply integrated into the project's build tasks, as evidenced by its usage across multiple task files (`copy.js`, `styles.js`, `images.js`, `paths.js`, `clean.js`). It is used for critical operations such as copying files, outputting compiled styles, processing images, resolving paths, and cleaning directories. Replacing `fs-extra` would require significant refactoring of these tasks to adapt to a different package's API or to revert to using the native `fs` module, which lacks some of the conveniences provided by `fs-extra`.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to `fs-extra` that provide similar functionality (e.g., `graceful-fs`, `mkdirp`, `rimraf`, `ncp`), finding a single package that offers the same comprehensive set of features might be challenging. Additionally, replacing `fs-extra` would require evaluating these alternatives for compatibility and performance, and potentially using multiple packages to cover all the functionalities currently provided by `fs-extra`. This could increase the complexity of the project's dependency management.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on `fs-extra`'s abandonment is relatively low. `fs-extra` is a well-maintained package with a large user base, and its abandonment would likely be preceded by ample warning and community discussion. However, given its critical role in the project's build process, any signs of abandonment would necessitate a proactive response to ensure the project's stability and maintainability.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the critical role `fs-extra` plays in the project's build process and its deep integration across multiple tasks, its abandonment would likely be directly impactful to the project. The importance of its functionality, the difficulty of replacing it due to its deep integration, and the challenges in finding suitable alternatives all contribute to this assessment. While the likelihood of abandonment is low, the potential impact justifies monitoring the package's status and community support.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The lodash.map function is used in the project to map over an array of story results and transform them into HTML elements. This functionality is crucial for rendering the story grid on the webpage. Given that it directly affects the user interface and the presentation of content, the functionality provided by lodash.map is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of lodash.map in the project is limited to a single file (loadStoryGrid.js) where it is used to map over an array of story results. The usage is straightforward and does not involve complex logic or deep integration with other parts of the codebase. Therefore, replacing lodash.map would not be particularly difficult in terms of integration depth.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to lodash.map, including the native JavaScript Array.prototype.map method, which provides similar functionality. Given the simplicity of the use case in the project, switching to an alternative would be relatively easy. The availability of suitable alternatives reduces the difficulty of replacing lodash.map.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. Lodash is a widely used and well-maintained library, and lodash.map is a core utility function that is unlikely to be abandoned. Additionally, the project's use of lodash.map is not tied to any external services or APIs that could change.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the functionality provided by lodash.map to the project, the ease of replacing it due to its shallow integration and the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of lodash.map would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

      "reasoning": "Prettier is a code formatting tool that ensures consistent code style across the project. While it is useful for maintaining code quality, it is not directly involved in the core functionality of the project, which is related to managing and displaying school data. Therefore, its importance to the project is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Prettier is integrated into the project as a development tool, primarily used during the build process or as a pre-commit hook. It does not deeply integrate into the project's core codebase or logic. Replacing it would mainly involve updating the build configuration or development scripts.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Prettier, such as ESLint (with formatting rules), StandardJS, or even custom scripts for code formatting. These alternatives can provide similar functionality, making it relatively easy to replace Prettier if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Prettier's abandonment is low. Prettier is a widely used and actively maintained tool, and its abandonment would not directly impact the project's ability to manage and display school data.",
      "score": 1
