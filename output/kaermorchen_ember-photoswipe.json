    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency 'photoswipe' is central to the functionality of the 'ember-photoswipe' project, as it provides the core gallery and lightbox features. The project's README and usage examples clearly indicate that 'photoswipe' is used to display images in a responsive and interactive manner, which is a key feature of the addon. Without 'photoswipe', the addon would lose its primary functionality, making it highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of 'photoswipe' into the 'ember-photoswipe' project is deep, as evidenced by the import statements in the index.js file and the usage in the component and templates. The project directly imports and uses 'photoswipe' JavaScript and CSS files, and the component is built around 'photoswipe' functionality. Replacing 'photoswipe' would require significant changes to the component and potentially the project's structure, indicating a high level of integration.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are other image gallery and lightbox libraries available, finding a suitable replacement that offers the same level of functionality, ease of use, and integration with Ember.js as 'photoswipe' does could be challenging. The project's reliance on specific 'photoswipe' features and its integration into the Ember.js ecosystem means that alternatives would need to be carefully evaluated for compatibility and feature parity, making the replacement process difficult.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on 'photoswipe's abandonment is moderate. While 'photoswipe' is actively maintained and widely used, changes in web standards, security vulnerabilities, or the emergence of significantly better alternatives could necessitate a switch. However, given 'photoswipe's current stability and feature set, such changes are not immediately foreseeable.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the central role of 'photoswipe' in providing the core functionality of the 'ember-photoswipe' project, its deep integration into the project's codebase, the challenges in finding a suitable replacement, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of 'photoswipe' would likely be directly impactful to the project.",
    "impactful": true
  },
  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency 'ember-load-initializers' is used to autoload initializer and instance initializer files in an Ember app. Given the project's focus on integrating PhotoSwipe into Ember applications, the core functionality does not heavily rely on initializers. The project's main functionality is centered around the PhotoSwipe integration, which is managed through other dependencies and custom code. Therefore, the importance of 'ember-load-initializers' to the project is relatively low.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of 'ember-load-initializers' in the project is minimal. It is used in a single file (tests/dummy/app/app.js) to load initializers. This suggests that the dependency is not deeply integrated into the project's codebase. Replacing or removing it would likely require minimal changes, primarily in the application initialization process.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to 'ember-load-initializers' that could serve as suitable replacements, such as manually loading initializers or using other Ember addons designed for similar purposes. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace 'ember-load-initializers' if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. 'ember-load-initializers' is a utility library with a specific, narrow use case. Changes in the Ember ecosystem or other external factors are unlikely to directly impact the necessity of this dependency for the project.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the low importance of 'ember-load-initializers' to the project's core functionality, its minimal integration, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external changes necessitating action, the abandonment of this dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @ember/test-helpers package is used for testing Ember applications, which is a critical part of the development process. However, in the context of the ember-photoswipe project, it is only used in test files and not in the main application code. This means that while it is important for ensuring the quality and reliability of the project, its direct impact on the application's functionality is minimal.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @ember/test-helpers package is integrated into the project's test suite, specifically in the test-helper.js file and the photo-swipe-test.js file. Its usage is limited to setting up the application for tests and rendering components during tests. This indicates a shallow level of integration, as it does not deeply affect the main application code.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @ember/test-helpers for testing Ember applications, such as ember-mocha and ember-cli-qunit. These alternatives provide similar functionality for testing Ember applications, making it relatively easy to replace @ember/test-helpers if necessary.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The Ember ecosystem is stable, and changes that would necessitate a replacement of @ember/test-helpers are unlikely in the near future. Additionally, since the dependency is only used in tests, the impact of its abandonment would be less severe compared to dependencies used in the main application code.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Given that @ember/test-helpers is only used in the test suite of the ember-photoswipe project and not in the main application code, its abandonment would have a minimal direct impact on the project. There are also readily available alternatives for testing Ember applications, further reducing the potential impact. Therefore, the abandonment of @ember/test-helpers would not likely be directly impactful to the project.",
