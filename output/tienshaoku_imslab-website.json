    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency 'react-scripts' is crucial for the project as it is used to start, build, and eject the React application. It is directly referenced in the 'scripts' section of the package.json file, indicating its essential role in the development and deployment process. Without 'react-scripts', the project would not be able to run or build, making it highly important.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Given that 'react-scripts' is integrated into the project's core scripts for starting, building, and ejecting the application, its integration is deep. Replacing it would require significant changes to the project's build and development process, including potentially rewriting the build configuration and scripts. This makes the replacement process difficult.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to 'react-scripts' such as 'Vite' or 'Parcel', migrating to these alternatives would require substantial effort. This includes rewriting build configurations, potentially adjusting the project structure, and ensuring compatibility with the existing codebase. The availability of alternatives does not significantly reduce the difficulty of replacement.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While 'react-scripts' is widely used and supported by the React community, changes in the React ecosystem or the broader JavaScript ecosystem could necessitate a move away from 'react-scripts'. However, such changes are not imminent or highly likely in the short term.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of 'react-scripts' to the project's build and development process, the depth of its integration, the difficulty of finding and migrating to suitable alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of 'react-scripts' would be highly impactful to the project.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "Prettier is a code formatter that ensures consistent code style across the project. While it is useful for maintaining code quality, it is not directly involved in the core functionality of the IMS Lab website. Its role is more about code aesthetics and readability rather than the website's operational features. Therefore, its importance to the project is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Prettier is integrated into the project through a configuration in the .vscode/settings.json file, which sets it as the default formatter for JavaScript files. This integration is minimal and does not deeply affect the project's codebase. Removing or replacing Prettier would not require significant changes to the project's code.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Prettier, such as ESLint, StandardJS, and Beautify, which can also enforce code style and formatting. These alternatives are widely used and could serve as suitable replacements for Prettier. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace Prettier if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on Prettier's abandonment is low. Prettier is a well-maintained project with a large community and is unlikely to be abandoned in the near future. Even if it were abandoned, the impact on the project would be minimal due to the availability of alternatives and the minimal integration of Prettier in the project.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance of Prettier to the project, its minimal integration, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of its abandonment, the abandonment of Prettier would not likely be directly impactful to the IMS Lab website.",
    "impactful": false

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @testing-library/jest-dom package provides custom jest matchers to test the state of the DOM, which is crucial for ensuring the UI behaves as expected in the IMS Lab website project. Given the project's reliance on React for building the UI, having reliable DOM testing utilities is essential for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project's testing setup, as indicated by its presence in the package.json file. However, the depth of its integration is not explicitly detailed in the provided context. It is used alongside other testing libraries, suggesting a moderate level of integration.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative libraries for DOM testing in React applications, such as Enzyme. However, @testing-library/jest-dom is specifically designed to work seamlessly with @testing-library/react, which is also used in the project. This makes it a more suitable choice compared to alternatives, reducing the difficulty of replacement.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The @testing-library/jest-dom package is widely used and maintained by the testing-library community, which reduces the risk of sudden abandonment. Additionally, the project's current setup does not indicate any immediate external pressures that would necessitate a change.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @testing-library/jest-dom for DOM testing in the project, its moderate level of integration, the availability of suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could transition to an alternative testing library if necessary, though it would require some effort.",
