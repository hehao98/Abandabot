      "reasoning": "Lodash is used extensively throughout the project for various utility functions such as object manipulation, array handling, and string processing. It is deeply integrated into the core functionality of the Postman Collection SDK, as evidenced by its usage in multiple files across the project. The dependency on Lodash for these utility functions suggests that it plays a crucial role in the project's operations.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "Lodash is integrated into the project at a deep level, with its utility functions being used in numerous files across the project. This includes core functionality such as property handling, collection manipulation, and utility functions. The widespread use of Lodash throughout the project indicates a high level of integration, making it difficult to replace without significant refactoring.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to Lodash, such as Ramda or native JavaScript methods, the project's extensive use of Lodash's specific utility functions and its deep integration into the codebase make finding a suitable replacement challenging. The alternatives would need to provide similar functionality and performance, and the project would require significant refactoring to adapt to a different utility library.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given Lodash's popularity and active maintenance, the likelihood of it being abandoned in the near future is low. However, the project's heavy reliance on Lodash means that any significant changes or deprecation in Lodash could have a substantial impact. The project would need to monitor Lodash's development and be prepared to act if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of Lodash to the project's functionality, its deep integration, the challenges in finding suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of Lodash would likely be directly impactful to the project. The project would need to undertake significant refactoring to replace Lodash, and the functionality provided by Lodash is crucial to the project's operations.",

      "reasoning": "The eslint-plugin-jsdoc is used for linting JSDoc comments in the project. While it helps maintain code quality and documentation standards, the core functionality of the postman-collection SDK does not directly depend on it. The SDK's primary purpose is to work with Postman Collections, and the linting provided by eslint-plugin-jsdoc is more of a development aid rather than a critical feature.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of eslint-plugin-jsdoc in the project is limited to the development environment, specifically for linting JSDoc comments. It is not deeply integrated into the core functionality of the SDK. The dependency is listed in the devDependencies section of the package.json, indicating its use is confined to development and testing phases.",

    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to eslint-plugin-jsdoc for linting JSDoc comments, such as jsdoc itself or other ESLint plugins that offer similar functionality. The availability of these alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace eslint-plugin-jsdoc if necessary.",

      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The project's core functionality is not dependent on eslint-plugin-jsdoc, and the dependency is used primarily for maintaining code quality and documentation standards. Changes in the external environment are unlikely to directly impact the project's use of this dependency.",
      "score": 1

    "reasoning": "Given the analysis, the abandonment of eslint-plugin-jsdoc would not likely be directly impactful to the postman-collection project. The dependency's role is supportive rather than critical, and there are viable alternatives available. The project could continue to function effectively without it, albeit with potential impacts on code quality and documentation standards.",

It is also mentioned in a comment in 'lib/util.js' regarding base64 encoding normalization. However, it does not appear to be deeply integrated into the core codebase of the project. The integration is limited to the testing setup, making it relatively easy to replace or remove.",

      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to Browserify for bundling JavaScript files, such as Webpack, Rollup, and Parcel.
