    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The aws-sdk is used for interacting with AWS services, which are crucial for many cloud-based functionalities. However, the project README does not explicitly mention AWS services as a core feature, suggesting that the dependency might not be central to the project's main functionalities.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The aws-sdk is listed in the package.json dependencies, but without specific code snippets or detailed usage overview, it's challenging to assess the depth of its integration. Given the lack of explicit mention in the README, it's likely integrated at a moderate level.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternatives to the aws-sdk, such as the AWS SDK for JavaScript v3, which is recommended by AWS. However, migrating to v3 or another alternative would require some effort, especially if the project has deeply integrated aws-sdk v2.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given that AWS has announced the maintenance mode for aws-sdk v2 and recommends migrating to v3, it's likely that external environmental changes will eventually force the project to act on the dependency's abandonment.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the moderate importance, integration depth, and availability of alternatives, the abandonment of aws-sdk v2 would likely be impactful but not critically so. The project would need to plan for migration to v3 or another alternative in the near future.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The pug dependency is used as the view engine for the project, which is crucial for rendering HTML templates. Given that the project is a social network with various pages and features, the ability to dynamically generate HTML content is essential. Therefore, the functionality provided by pug is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of pug in the project is straightforward, as it is set as the view engine in the app.js file. This means that pug is used for rendering all views in the project. However, since it is only configured in one place, replacing it would not require extensive changes throughout the codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative template engines available for Node.js, such as EJS, Handlebars, and Mustache, which could serve as suitable replacements for pug. These alternatives are well-maintained and provide similar functionality, making it relatively easy to replace pug if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on pug's abandonment is low. Pug is a widely used and well-maintained project with a large community. While any project can potentially be abandoned, there is no immediate indication that pug is at risk of being abandoned.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of pug as the view engine for the project, its straightforward integration, the availability of alternative template engines, and the low likelihood of its abandonment, the abandonment of pug would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could relatively easily switch to an alternative template engine if necessary.",
    "impactful": false

  "dep3_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The project, Squakr, is a social network that relies on EJS for rendering views. Given the nature of the project, which includes features like account systems, microblogging, and notifications, the rendering of views is crucial for the user interface and experience. EJS is used to dynamically generate HTML content based on user data and interactions, which is a core functionality of the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "From the provided Dockerfile, it appears that EJS is integrated into the project's build and deployment process. The views directory, which likely contains EJS templates, is copied during the Docker build process. This indicates that EJS is deeply integrated into the project's structure and deployment workflow. Replacing EJS would require significant changes to the project's build and deployment process, as well as potentially rewriting view templates.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to EJS for templating in Node.js applications, such as Pug (formerly Jade), Handlebars, and Mustache. These alternatives offer similar functionality and could potentially serve as replacements. However, transitioning to a new templating engine would require rewriting all existing templates and possibly adjusting the project's build and deployment process to accommodate the new engine.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on EJS's abandonment is relatively low. EJS is a widely used templating engine with a large community and active maintenance. However, if EJS were to be abandoned, the project would need to consider the impact on its build and deployment process, as well as the effort required to transition to a new templating engine.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of EJS to the project's functionality, its deep integration into the project's structure and deployment process, the availability of alternatives, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of EJS would likely be impactful to the project. The project would need to invest significant effort to transition to a new templating engine, which could affect development timelines and resources.",
