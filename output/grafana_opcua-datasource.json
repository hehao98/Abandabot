    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @grafana/ui dependency is used extensively throughout the project for UI components such as Input, Button, Checkbox, and more. These components are fundamental for building the user interface of the Grafana plugin, including query editors, configuration editors, and various interactive elements. Given the project's nature as a Grafana plugin, the UI components provided by @grafana/ui are crucial for maintaining consistency with Grafana's design and functionality standards.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @grafana/ui dependency is deeply integrated into the project, as evidenced by its usage in multiple components across the codebase. It is used in key parts of the application, including the QueryEditor, ConfigEditor, and various custom components. Replacing this dependency would require significant refactoring of the UI components to either use alternative libraries or custom-built components, which would be a complex and time-consuming process.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternative UI libraries available for React, such as Material-UI or Ant Design, replacing @grafana/ui would not be straightforward. @grafana/ui is specifically designed for Grafana plugins, ensuring compatibility and consistency with Grafana's ecosystem. Alternative libraries would require custom styling and potentially additional logic to match Grafana's UI/UX standards, making the replacement process challenging.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given that @grafana/ui is a core part of the Grafana ecosystem and maintained by Grafana Labs, the likelihood of it being abandoned is low. Grafana Labs has a strong incentive to maintain and update their UI library to support their ecosystem of plugins and applications. However, in the hypothetical scenario of abandonment, the impact on the project would be significant due to the deep integration and importance of the dependency.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the extensive use of @grafana/ui in the project for essential UI components, its deep integration into the codebase, the challenges in finding suitable alternatives, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the dependency's hypothetical abandonment would be highly impactful to the project. The project relies heavily on @grafana/ui for maintaining UI consistency and functionality within the Grafana ecosystem, making it a critical dependency.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The style-loader is used to inject CSS into the DOM, which is a fundamental part of styling web applications. However, given the project's focus on data visualization and interaction with OPC UA servers, the visual styling provided by style-loader, while important, is not the core functionality of the project. The project could potentially function with basic or alternative styling methods.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The style-loader is integrated into the project's webpack configuration for handling CSS and SCSS files. It is used alongside css-loader and sass-loader, indicating a standard setup for webpack projects. Replacing it would require adjustments to the webpack configuration but does not seem to involve deep or complex integration within the project's codebase.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to style-loader for injecting CSS into the DOM, such as mini-css-extract-plugin, which is recommended for production builds. These alternatives can provide similar functionality with potentially better performance or additional features. The availability of suitable replacements makes it less difficult to replace style-loader.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. The style-loader is a widely used package with a large community and is part of the webpack ecosystem, which is also widely used. However, the project itself is deprecated, which reduces the likelihood of needing to act on any dependency's abandonment.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of style-loader to the project's functionality, its level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of style-loader would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The project could transition to an alternative with moderate effort, and the project's deprecated status further reduces the impact.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "TypeScript is crucial for the project as it is used for type checking and compiling the code. The project's build and development scripts rely on TypeScript for compiling and type checking, as seen in the package.json and various configuration files. This indicates that TypeScript is integral to the development and build process of the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "TypeScript is deeply integrated into the project's build and development process. It is used in the webpack configuration, jest configuration, and the tsconfig.json file. This deep integration suggests that replacing TypeScript would require significant changes to the project's build and development setup.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternatives to TypeScript, such as Babel with type checking plugins or using plain JavaScript, these alternatives may not provide the same level of type safety and developer experience that TypeScript offers. Additionally, transitioning to an alternative would require significant effort to refactor the codebase and update the build and development configurations.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given TypeScript's widespread adoption and active development, the likelihood of it being abandoned is low. However, if external environmental changes, such as a significant shift in the JavaScript ecosystem away from TypeScript, were to occur, it could force the project to act on the dependency's abandonment.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of TypeScript to the project's build and development process, its deep integration, the difficulty of finding a suitable alternative, and the low likelihood of abandonment, the abandonment of TypeScript would likely be directly impactful to the project.",
