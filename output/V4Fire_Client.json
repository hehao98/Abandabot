    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @swc/helpers package is used in conjunction with @swc/core, which is a fast TypeScript/JavaScript compiler. Given the project's reliance on TypeScript (as indicated by the presence of TypeScript-related dependencies and scripts), @swc/helpers likely plays a crucial role in the build process, providing essential helper functions for the compilation. This makes the functionality provided by @swc/helpers highly important to the project.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration depth of @swc/helpers in the project is not explicitly detailed in the provided context. However, considering its role in the build process alongside @swc/core, it is likely integrated at a foundational level. Replacing it would require adjustments in the build configuration and potentially in the code that relies on its helper functions, indicating a moderate to high level of integration difficulty.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternatives to @swc/helpers, such as Babel helpers, which provide similar functionality. However, the choice of @swc/helpers might be tied to the project's preference for @swc/core over Babel for compilation. While alternatives exist, the specific integration and potential performance benefits of @swc/helpers might make the transition to alternatives non-trivial.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low to moderate. The project's build process is somewhat insulated from external changes, and the abandonment of a helper library like @swc/helpers would not immediately break the build. However, long-term maintenance and security concerns could eventually necessitate action.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @swc/helpers to the project's build process, the moderate difficulty of replacing it due to its integration level, the availability of alternatives, and the low to moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of @swc/helpers would be impactful but not critically so. The project could manage the transition to an alternative, though it would require effort.",

      "reasoning": "The dependency 'dpdm' is used in the project's test script to check for circular dependencies. While this is a useful tool for maintaining code quality, it is not directly involved in the core functionality of the project. Therefore, its importance to the project is moderate.",

    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of 'dpdm' in the project is limited to a specific test script. It is not deeply integrated into the core codebase or the build process. This makes it relatively easy to replace or remove if necessary.",

However, the project's specific implementation and usage of 'path-to-regexp' would require careful consideration and testing to ensure compatibility and functionality are maintained with an alternative package. The availability of alternatives does not necessarily make the replacement process straightforward.",

      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the dependency is crucial for the project's routing logic, the JavaScript ecosystem is dynamic, and changes in the environment or the emergence of more efficient alternatives could influence the need to replace 'path-to-regexp'.
