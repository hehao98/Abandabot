    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @github/combobox-nav dependency provides essential combobox navigation behavior, which is a core functionality of the @github/auto-complete-element project. The project relies on this dependency to manage the interaction between the input field and the list of options, including keyboard navigation and selection. Given its central role in enabling the auto-complete feature, the functionality provided by @github/combobox-nav is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The @github/combobox-nav dependency is deeply integrated into the @github/auto-complete-element project. It is used in multiple critical parts of the code, including the initialization of the combobox behavior, managing the visibility of the results list, and handling the selection of options. The dependency is tightly coupled with the project's core logic, making it difficult to replace without significant refactoring.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "While there are alternative packages that provide combobox or autocomplete functionality, finding a suitable replacement that matches the specific behavior and integration requirements of the @github/auto-complete-element project could be challenging. The project's reliance on the specific API and behavior of @github/combobox-nav means that alternatives would need to be carefully evaluated and potentially adapted, increasing the difficulty of replacement.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. While the dependency is crucial for the project's functionality, the JavaScript ecosystem is dynamic, and changes in browser standards or the emergence of new libraries could influence the need for action. However, given the dependency's current stability and the project's specific requirements, such changes are not immediately foreseeable.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of the @github/combobox-nav dependency to the @github/auto-complete-element project, its deep integration, the challenges in finding suitable alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of external changes necessitating action, the abandonment of this dependency would likely be directly impactful to the project. The project would face significant challenges in maintaining its core functionality without this dependency, making it impactful.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The axe-core dependency is used for accessibility testing in the project. While accessibility is crucial, the core functionality of the auto-complete element does not directly depend on axe-core. It is used for ensuring the component is accessible, which is important but not critical for the basic operation of the auto-complete feature.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of axe-core in the project is minimal. It is used in a validator.js file and a test file (axe-test.js). The usage is limited to configuring axe-core with custom rules for accessibility testing. This indicates a shallow integration, making it relatively easy to replace or remove if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to axe-core for accessibility testing, such as Lighthouse, Pa11y, and WAVE. These alternatives can provide similar functionality for accessibility testing, making it feasible to replace axe-core if needed.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on axe-core's abandonment is low. Accessibility testing tools are generally stable, and changes in this area are gradual. Additionally, the project's reliance on axe-core is not deep, reducing the impact of its potential abandonment.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance, integration depth, availability of alternatives, and likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of axe-core would not likely be directly impactful to the project. The dependency is used for accessibility testing, which, while important, does not affect the core functionality of the auto-complete element. The shallow integration and availability of alternatives further reduce the potential impact.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The rollup-plugin-node-resolve is used in the build process of the project to resolve modules using the Node resolution algorithm. This functionality is crucial for bundling the project, especially since the project is an ES module and relies on third-party modules in `node_modules`. Without this plugin, the project would face significant challenges in bundling and resolving dependencies, making it highly important to the project's build process.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The rollup-plugin-node-resolve is integrated into the project's build configuration, as indicated by its presence in the `devDependencies` of the package.json file. However, the provided context does not include specific details on how deeply it is integrated into the project's codebase. Given that it is a build tool, its integration is likely limited to the build process rather than being deeply embedded in the application code.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to rollup-plugin-node-resolve, such as Webpack's resolve plugin, esbuild's native module resolution, and others. These alternatives can provide similar functionality in resolving modules. The availability of these alternatives makes it less difficult to replace rollup-plugin-node-resolve, provided that the project is willing to adjust its build configuration accordingly.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is moderate. Changes in the Node.js ecosystem or in the module resolution algorithm could potentially impact the plugin's functionality. However, given the stability of the Node.js module resolution algorithm and the plugin's maintenance status, this scenario is not highly likely in the near future.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of rollup-plugin-node-resolve to the project's build process, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of external changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would be impactful but not critically so. The project could transition to an alternative with some effort, but the plugin's current role in the build process is significant.",
