      "reasoning": "The project `make-magic` is a tool for quickly scaffolding an app with Magic authentication baked-in. The dependency `ejs` is used for templating, which is a core functionality for generating boilerplate codes. Given that the project's primary purpose is to scaffold apps, the templating functionality provided by `ejs` is crucial for generating the necessary files and code structure. Therefore, the functionality provided by `ejs` is highly important to the project.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of `ejs` in the project appears to be deep, as it is used for generating boilerplate codes, which is a core functionality of the project. The project's README mentions the use of templates, and the package.json file lists `ejs` as a dependency. However, without specific code snippets showing the usage of `ejs`, it's challenging to assess the exact depth of integration. Given the project's nature, it's reasonable to assume that `ejs` is deeply integrated into the scaffolding process.",

    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative templating engines available for Node.js, such as Pug, Handlebars, and Mustache, which could potentially replace `ejs`. These alternatives offer similar functionality and could be suitable replacements. However, switching to an alternative would require rewriting the templating logic and potentially adjusting the project's architecture to accommodate the new templating engine. While alternatives are available, the effort required to replace `ejs` is non-trivial.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on `ejs`'s abandonment is moderate. While `ejs` is a widely used templating engine, the JavaScript ecosystem is dynamic, and changes in dependencies or security vulnerabilities could necessitate a switch. However, `ejs` has been stable and actively maintained, reducing the immediate likelihood of such changes.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of `ejs` to the project's core functionality, its deep integration, the availability of alternatives, and the moderate likelihood of external changes, the abandonment of `ejs` would likely be impactful to the project. The project relies on `ejs` for generating boilerplate codes, and replacing it would require significant effort. Therefore, the abandonment of `ejs` would be directly impactful to the project.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency @types/pretty-time is a TypeScript type definition for the pretty-time package, which is used for formatting time durations in a human-readable way. Given that the project, make-magic, is a scaffolding tool, the functionality provided by pretty-time and its type definitions is not central to the core functionality of the project. It is likely used for logging or displaying time-related information during the scaffolding process, which is a minor aspect of the tool. Therefore, the importance of this dependency to the project is relatively low.",

    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The integration of @types/pretty-time in the project's codebase is minimal. It is a type definition package, which means it is only used during development for type checking and does not affect the runtime behavior of the application. The depth of its integration is shallow, as it does not interact deeply with the project's core logic or other dependencies. Replacing or removing this dependency would have a negligible impact on the project's codebase.",

    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternative packages available that provide similar functionality to pretty-time, such as humanize-duration and moment-duration-format. Additionally, TypeScript type definitions for these alternatives are readily available. Given the availability of suitable replacements, replacing @types/pretty-time would not be difficult. The project could easily switch to another package for formatting time durations without significant effort.",

    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the abandonment of @types/pretty-time is low. Since it is a type definition package, its abandonment would not directly affect the runtime behavior of the application. The project could continue to use the existing type definitions or switch to an alternative without immediate urgency. Environmental changes, such as updates to TypeScript or the pretty-time package, are unlikely to necessitate immediate action.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the low importance of @types/pretty-time to the project, its shallow integration, the availability of alternative packages, and the low likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of this dependency would not be directly impactful to the project. The project could continue to function normally without this dependency, and replacing it would not require significant effort.",

Given that the project is a tool for scaffolding apps, maintaining high code quality is paramount.",

However, `eslint-plugin-import` is widely used and has comprehensive support for ES2015+ syntax, making it a preferred choice. The availability of alternatives does not significantly reduce the difficulty of replacement due to the specific features and rules provided by `eslint-plugin-import`.",
