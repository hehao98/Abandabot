      "reasoning": "The uri-js dependency is used in the project for URI resolution, which is a critical part of JSON schema validation. The project's functionality heavily relies on correctly resolving URIs to validate JSON schemas accurately. Given its role in the core functionality of the project, the importance of uri-js is high.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency is integrated into the project's test suite, specifically in the resolve.spec.ts file, where it is used to test URI resolution. The integration is not deeply embedded into the main codebase but is crucial for ensuring the correctness of URI resolution in the project. The integration level is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are alternative packages available for URI resolution, such as fast-uri, which is also used in the project. The availability of alternatives suggests that replacing uri-js would be feasible, although it might require some adjustments to the codebase. The difficulty of replacement is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "Given the critical role of URI resolution in JSON schema validation and the existence of alternative packages, it is somewhat likely that external environmental changes, such as the abandonment of uri-js, could force the project to act. However, the project already uses an alternative (fast-uri), which mitigates this risk. The likelihood is moderate.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of uri-js in URI resolution for JSON schema validation, its moderate level of integration, the availability of alternative packages, and the moderate likelihood of external environmental changes forcing action, the abandonment of uri-js would be impactful but manageable. The project already uses an alternative package, which reduces the potential impact.",

  "dep2_report": {
    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The dependency eslint-config-prettier is used to turn off all rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier. Given that Ajv is a JSON schema validator, the primary focus is on validation rather than code formatting. Therefore, while eslint-config-prettier is useful for maintaining code quality and consistency, it is not critical to the core functionality of Ajv.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "eslint-config-prettier is integrated into the project by being added to the ESLint configuration. This is a straightforward process and does not involve deep integration into the codebase. The dependency is used to override other ESLint configurations, which means its integration is relatively shallow and can be easily removed or replaced.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to eslint-config-prettier that can be used to disable ESLint rules that conflict with Prettier. These include manually configuring ESLint rules to avoid conflicts or using other ESLint plugins that provide similar functionality. The availability of alternatives makes it relatively easy to replace eslint-config-prettier if necessary.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. eslint-config-prettier is a widely used and maintained package, and its abandonment would not directly impact the core functionality of Ajv. Additionally, the project could continue to function without it, albeit with potential code formatting issues.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "reasoning": "Given the analysis, the abandonment of eslint-config-prettier would not likely be directly impactful to the Ajv project. The dependency is not critical to the core functionality of Ajv, is shallowly integrated, has available alternatives, and the likelihood of external changes forcing action is low.",

    "importance": {
      "reasoning": "The @rollup/plugin-typescript is used in the rollup.config.js file to handle TypeScript files during the build process. Given that Ajv is a TypeScript project, this plugin is crucial for compiling TypeScript code into JavaScript, which is essential for the project's build and deployment processes.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "integration": {
      "reasoning": "The plugin is integrated into the rollup.config.js file, which is a central configuration file for the build process. It is used alongside other plugins like commonjs, nodeResolve, and json, indicating a moderate level of integration. However, its role is specific to handling TypeScript files, and its integration is not deeply embedded across the entire codebase.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "alternatives": {
      "reasoning": "There are several alternatives to @rollup/plugin-typescript, such as @rollup/plugin-babel with @babel/preset-typescript, or using tsc directly for TypeScript compilation. These alternatives can provide similar functionality, making the replacement of @rollup/plugin-typescript feasible, though it may require adjustments to the build configuration.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "likelihood": {
      "reasoning": "The likelihood of external environmental changes forcing the project to act on the dependency's abandonment is low. TypeScript and Rollup are both stable and widely used technologies, and the plugin is maintained by the Rollup team, which reduces the risk of sudden abandonment. However, the open-source nature of the project means there is always a non-zero risk.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Considering the importance of @rollup/plugin-typescript in the build process of a TypeScript project like Ajv, its abandonment would be impactful. However, the availability of alternatives and the specific, rather than deep, integration of the plugin mitigate the overall impact. The project could transition to an alternative solution with some effort, but the initial disruption would be significant.",
