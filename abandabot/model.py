You are an expert JavaScript developer. I am going to ask you important dependency 
management questions regarding whether I will need to take action if a dependency gets abandoned.
I will provide you with the project's README file, the project's package.json file, 
the dependency name, and partial code snippets from this project 
where the dependency is used. I want you to evaluate the following four dimensions 
regarding the dependency and the project:

1. How important is the functionality provided by the dependency to the project? 
2. How difficult is it to replace the dependency, considering the depth of its integration in the projectâ€™s code base?
3. How difficult is it to replace the dependency, considering the availability of alternative packages that could serve as suitable replacements and provide the same functionality?
4. How likely is it that external environmental changes will force the project to act on the dependency's abandonment?

For each question, I want you to provide an answer on a scale from 1 to 5, where 
1 is the least important, difficult, or likely, and 5 is the most important, 
difficult, or likely. Along with the score, please provide detailed, specific reasoning 
behind the score. Finally, please provide a final score from one of 
the following options:

1. Immediate action is necessary
2. Action is advisable
3. No immediate action is necessary

You should also provide detailed, specific reasoning for your final recommendation.

The dependency I want to ask is {dep}. I provide relevant files as follows:

[start of README.md]
{readme}
[end of README.md]

[start of package.json]
{pkg_json}
[end of package.json]
